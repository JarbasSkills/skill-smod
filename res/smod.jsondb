            "description": "LaColpa - Post Tenebras Lux (Full Album) “Post Tenebras Lux” is the second album by Blackened Doom / Noise project LaColpa. After the debut album “Mea Maxima Culpa”, which was released to critical acclaim in 2017 and ended up being featured in many album of the year charts by the likes of Cvlt Nation and The Wire Magazine amongst many others, LaColpa are back with their highly anticipated sophomore release.  “Post Tenebras Lux” is a monolithically dark and ominous album, showcasing how the band’s distinctive Doom / Noise sound has ultimately shapeshifted into something monstrously heavier and sludgier, all the while experimenting with some of the most painful soundscapes of improvisational noise and drone metal.\n\nThe end result is a 44 minutes long nightmare evoking menacing visions of pain, whilst the echo of our laments bounces around the infinite walls of Nothingness. Thematically, this new album outlines LaColpa’s philosophy of pain, deeply rooted in the human condition of eternal suffering. Agony is the only hope for transcendence, and yet here faith is worth nothing, because crosses are invisible and only pain is real. Accepting defeat, embracing pain, becoming a martyr won’t lead to any illumination - but to the realization that our existence is only an error, a mistake, a sin performed by God himself in the act of projecting an image of his real self upon us.\n\n1. Theosophy of Pain\n2. Black Opal\n3. Martyrdrome\n4. Welcoming the Agony\n5. Relics\n\nSupport LaColpa by purchasing the album here https://bruciarecords.bandcamp.com/album/post-tenebras-lux\n\nLaColpa\nhttps://lacolpa666.bandcamp.com\n\nBrucia Records\nhttp://www.bruciarecords.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LaColpa666/",

            "description": "Empty Trail - Somewhere (New Song) Expression of one’s raw and primal self should not be an empty pursuit, but rather be one filled with unbridled passion. Introspection sometimes takes place in the parts of oneself that are kept private and quiet, shadowed by social conditioning that offers the deceiving sense of safety and sanity. The voice of Empty Trail is loud, bellowing deep within the soul of the three-piece Hard Rock band that calls Austin, Texas its home. And Empty Trail wants its voice heard.\n\n\n\nSinger/guitarist Rick Lambert originally began the concept of the band as a personal project during his stint in Los Angeles. After recording his first EP, entitled Obscured, while roaming the City of Angels, He decided to relocate to Austin after recruiting drummer Rom Gov and bassist\n\nShane Wall in in the fall of 2016. “I wanted something that sounded grungey but with a modern sonic appeal,” explains Lambert. “Bands like Soundgarden and Alice in Chains with an added twist definitely came to mind.” \n\n\n\nEmpty Trail received an overwhelmingly positive response after taking their act on the road, especially in their home state of Texas. High demand for more music prompted the group to enlist Kfir Gov to produce a brand new single, “My World,” which exemplifies the full embodiment of what Empty Trail is meant to be. Recorded at Evil Snail Studios in 2017, “My World” would prove to be a massive turning point. “It was essentially the sum of all the best parts of the band condensed in the greatest way possible,” says Lambert.\n\n\n\nThe success of their new single caught the attention of music industry aficionados Cristian Machado (Ill Nino), Johnny Z of Megaforce Records, and Lou Brutus of HardDrive Radio, and with good reason. “My World” has more than 400,000 streams on Spotify alone, as well as continuous airplay on Rock stations across the United States. Golden Robot Records also noticed the band’s meteoric rise, and quickly signed Empty Trail to produce a follow-up EP entitled Lost, featuring “My World” as a bonus track. The EP has been streamed over 700,000 times with the video for the title track surpassing 120,000 YouTube views.\n\n\n\nEmpty Trail takes pride on building a network of fans that they consider family. The band spends much of its time engaging with followers through Instagram and Facebook, while fans from all over the world have shown their appreciation by creating international online fan pages, handmade\n\nartwork, and even covers of their music. The wait between releases will soon be over, as Empty Trail’s latest single “Somewhere” dropped on music platforms worldwide on August 21st. Lambert explains, “This song is about hope, much like many of our songs. ‘Somewhere’ is about imagining a better outcome, dreaming for a better world. I think that type of reflection and introspection is pivotal to any kind of positive\n\nchange.”\n\n\nSupport Empty Trail by purchasing the single here https://li.sten.to/d9eeP6X?fbclid=IwAR0I6YlMVpsoD2SOPNvQFbLl8kpVkxt1ZLefvQtw-3dRlk0xjhQ8ncpzVe4\n\n\nhttps://emptytrail.bandcamp.com/\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/emptytrailmusic\n\n\nhttps://www.emptytrail.com/",

            "description": "Two Headed Emperor - The Happy Medium And A Depressed Conjurer (Full Album)  A contemporary classic, The Happy Medium & A Depressed Conjurer by English Progressive Rockers The Two Headed Emperor is truly something to behold. Wearing their influences on their sleeve and weaving their way into our psyche, The Two Headed Emperor makes me think of bands creating music that truly meant something in decades gone by. To name but a few, this album reminded me at times of Genesis, Peter Hammill & Van der Graaf Generator, King Crimson, Egg, Soft Machine, The Fall, Captain Beefheart, Faust, Can, etc etc. \n\n\n\nThink of the best aspects of these bands, fused together with a New Wave edge and it will give you some idea of where The Two Headed Emperor is coming from. The implementation of new technology enhancing ideas of old is admirable and superbly executed. Lyrically excellent, most definitely contemporary and topical. Quite simply, an astonishing achievement, positively brimming over with ideas and musical concepts from Barry Lamb & Peter Ashby. Falling A Records is the label to look out for right now, promoting music in a contemporary setting, connected to the best of our rock music heritage. \n\n\n\n1.  The Happy Medium\n2.  Inspired By Concrete\n3.  The Quiet Room\n4.  Architects Of Culture\n5.  The Wolf And The Lamb\n6.  A Field Of Damage\n7.  侘寂\n8.  Duplicity And Complicity\n9.  A Depressed Conjurer (i) Reflection\n10. A Depressed Conjurer (ii) Confession\n11. A Depressed Conjurer (iii) Metanoia\n12.

            "description": "Ancestros Cord - Ancient City (New Full EP) Ancestros Cord is a magnetic neo-psychedelic alternative heavy rock band, hailing from St. Augustine Florida.  Ozzie Suarez (guitar) started Ancestros Cord with Kevin Montgomery (vocals/bass) in 2014. Anthony Petrizzo (drums) completed this 3 piece heavy alt rock band and they have been playing shows around the NE Florida region ever since. Their sound combines 70's psychedelic rock with 90's alternative, but the feel is still soulful. Ancient City acquired it's name because all of the songs were written and recorded in Ancestros Cord's hometown of St. Augustine Florida. \n\n1.  Syd on Stage\n2.  Psycle\n3.

            "description": "Poor Little Things - Disco's Burning (New Full Album) Poor Little Things is the collaboration of Tina Jackson and Rollerball guitarist Dave Talon.  Disco's Burning is their debut full length album, released in September 2019. This is thirty minutes of well-crafted pop/rock tunage that is guaranteed to recharge your rock n roll battery. Another nine songs that are laced with catchy choruses, appealing lead vocals, cool guitars and more hooks than a tackle shop.  First song out of the gate is ‘Panic Attack’ – an infectious hard rocker that’ll leave you short of breath, and dizzy with delight. \r\n\r\nNext up is ‘The Rock n Roll’ – the first single off ‘Disco’s Burning’. This is classic mid 70’s guitar pop with a mid-song break and clap-along chorus and like many of their compositions, you will be singing this one in your sleep. Dave Talon has the uncanny ability to make his guitar sing – yet slash and sting too – and there’s no greater example of these than on this track. Listen out for the keys which really do round out ‘The Rock n Roll’ nicely – shine on Nicky Hopkins. Anyone who has ever been saved by rock n roll can relate to this.\r\n\r\nOther notables on ‘Disco’s Burning’ are the rollicking 70’s stomp of ‘Déjà Vu’ and the wonderful title track (Martina Jackson’s neat vocal inflections here are a real treat). You want more ? Another one that’ll win you over is the frenetic and riff-laden ‘Wait’n On The Line’ – which conjures up images of a denim-clad Rick Parfitt playing a V. What’s not to like ?! This outfit continue to produce catchy, uplifting rock n roll which more people need to be aware of. \r\n\r\nReview here https://australianrockreview.com/2019/10/25/album-review-poor-little-things-discos-burning-2019/\r\n\r\n1.

            "description": "The Pilgrim - Dragonfly (New Song) The Pilgrim has a new album coming out on Heavy Psych Sounds April 26th. The album is called Walking Into The Forest. This is Dragonfly which is featured on the upcoming album. Gabriele Fiori -- already frontman of Rome-based outfits Black Rainbows and Killer Boogie and a key figure in Europe’s heavy underground as the head of the Heavy Psych Sounds label and booking agency -- was not exactly lacking for things to do. And yet, a couple years back, The Pilgrim started to nebulously take shape as an idea for a solo-project, something different than the hard-driving psychedelia and garage heavy rock for which he’d already been so revered. It wasn’t until Jan. 2018 that he really got to putting songs together, but the end result on Walking into the Forest is a space-folk release with a personality unto itself.\n\nSupport The Pilgrim by pre ordering the album here https://heavypsychsoundsrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-pilgrim-walking-into-the-forest-presale\n\nhttps://www.heavypsychsounds.com/bands/the-pilgrim.htm\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/THEPILGRIMACOUSTIC/",

            "description": "Brother O' Brother began in late 2013, transitioning to a 2 piece in 2014 and has never looked back. Defying notions of what a 2 piece act should be, Brother O' Brother's live performance has been dubbed the best live performance in all of Indianapolis by multiple press outlets. Mix MC5 with early Black Keys and you've got it. B.O.B. has toured to the tune of nearly 100 dates in 2016, received critical acclaim, played both Third Man Records locations, pumped out 6 new vinyl projects on 4 differrent independent labels, and started their own independent highly custom vinyl label Romanus Records in 2016. With the arrival of their new album “Neon Native” in 2017, Brother O’ Brother will continue their DIY fuzz ascent.\n\nThis is the official music video for Sunshine.  Sunshine is the 3rd track on their latest full length album Neon Native.  Neon Native gives Banta and Swopes a little wiggle room to stretch out musically. All of the swampy blues rock that made Show Pony special, is here in all its glory. Guitars are crunchy and thick, playing both lead and rhythm simultaneously. Drums are crisp and fat, sometimes battling the over-the-top vocals for the spotlight (like any crazy drummer should). But the experimentation is what makes the album unique.\n\n“16 Flowers” gives us a glimpse into the rarely seen punk side of Brother O’ Brother. It would be next to impossible to listen to this song while driving and not get a speeding ticket. “Sunshine” flirts with Collective Soul-esque power pop. “White Noise” fuses an acoustic country riff with an almost hypnotic kick drum. And I don’t even know where to begin with the unexpected “Life On Mars” cover.  With a million miles, multiple releases, and record sales behind them, Brother O’ Brother uses Neon Native to prove they’re far more exciting than any other blues-rock duo in the indie music scene. The album utilizes the momentum set by Show Pony and tightens up every single element. It’s the same sound we’ve all come to know and love but now expanded upon.\n\nReview from http://www.50thirdand3rd.com/brother-o-brother-neon-native-album-review/\n\nBuy vinyl: romanusrecords.myshopify.com\n\nhttps://brotherobrother.bandcamp.com/album/neon-native-2\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BrotherOBrother\n\nhttp://brotherobrother.com/",

            "description": "Now this is what good garage-punk is supposed to sound like. Burning up from down south in Tallahassee, FL, Switchblade Cheetah recently released their latest lo-fi opus, Chapel of the Bitch.  Chapel of the Bitch is “a masterpiece” putting together all the best elements of raw emotional volatile rock’n’roll from the past 70 years. From surf to hardcore—this album has it all!  The album is led by single “All That Blood” which is a rollicking glam-fuzz rock number in a similar vein to Ty Segall but still altogether Switchblade Cheetah’s own. There’s a moment in the chorus where the vocal drops out for a moment, not unlike a fist-cocking backwards, before the follow through punch of “BLOOD!” Love it.\n\nReview by  Mike Mehalick http://speakimge.com/simge-survey-getting-to-know-switchblade-cheetah-stream-all-that-blood/\n\n1.

Amazing blend of doom styles , yet always maintaining a Sabbath vibe throughout. I also am reminded of Pallbearer at times.  This reminds me of the first few Sahg records, but with a tiny bit more doom and quite a bit more blues elements. Like Sahg meets Cream. There is an awesome organ part in track 2, even though Snowchild seems to be and sounds like a power trio. Superb stuff.\n\n1.  Age of Change\n2.  Born in Flames\n3.  Kings of Koch\n4.

            "description": "The BeatChess - Tuboculimanica (Full Album) The BeatChess is the 21st century classic hard rock band.  The group was founded in 2012 and hails from Ukraine. Now the band plays original material in English. Tuboculimanica is their new full album, released in 2020.  As a hard rock album should, \"Tuboculimanica\" has its powerful opener called \"I Found Love\" (although the term \"hard rock\" is quite conditional). The song clearly conveys the mood of the record, with the riff having such a powerful grip that you won`t get it out of your head so easily. This track has enough balls to become an arena anthem. \"Outside / Inside\" is loaded with a catchy riff again, and quite simple yet catchy lyrics. You`ll start singing along to it after listening a couple of times. There's also this analog vibe and drive at the same time.\n\nRead full review here https://www.neformat.com.ua/en/reviews/the-beatchess-tuboculimanica-2020.html\n\n1.  Intro\n2.  I Found Love\n3.  Samy's Wife\n4.  Inside Outside\n5.  The Soft Song (Is It Real)\n6.  Fire Walk With Me\n7.  Seekers In The Dark\n8.  Crazy Grandpa\n9.  Outro\n\nLong live Tuboculimanica!\n\nMusic:\nAnatoly Yakovlev - bass, vocals\nArtem Glushkov - guitar\nAndrey Serezhkin - drums\n\nSound producer - Chester Ivanena, Free Bird Studio\nFree The System!\n\nYou can buy the album on iTunes  https://music.apple.com/de/album/1537581382?uo=4&app=itunes&mt=1&at=1000l9WJ&ct=bq\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thebeatchess/\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/7nDLEtSH73XH3S423y8YD6?si=uGXtn6EmSxicDBxdVhd9jA\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thebeatchessrockband/sets/tuboculimanica-2020",

            "description": "Demonauta - Temaukel, The Spirit Before Time (Full Album) Demonauta is a Heavy Fuzz Rock band from Santiago, Chile. \"Temaukel, The Spirit Before Time\" was released in 2018. This follows up \"Tierra del Fuego\" nicely with its signature Chilean style of soaring fuzz. The spell binding psychedelic riffs melt your mind combining both English and Spanish lyrics with spacey blues and progressive stoner jams. This album is a sheer tour de force in fuzz-ridden bass-heavy desert stoner rock.\n\nReview by Bucky\n  \n1.  Sons of Black Sun - 0:00\n2.  Blues para Angela Loij - 4:58\n3.  Temaukel - 10:45\n4.

            "description": "Oddplay - Bluff (Full Album)  Oddplay is an Instrumental duo from Bulgaria. Oddplay presents their 4th studio album, “Bluff”. The album is entirely instrumental just like their previous work and contains 11 tracks. Bluff is a bit different from previous albums because it is filled up with much more heaviness.  They are always on the run searching for new inspirations and continue to evolve their signature sound, trying to blend smooth guitar and bass rhythms with rawer, heavier riffs interspersed.\n\nStandout tracks, are ‘Sunseeker’, ‘Spoon Bender’, ‘Depths’ and the darker ‘Decrepit’. Fans of psychedelic stoner rock and connoisseurs of instrumental music will find much to love in ‘Bluff’, which, as their three other albums, remains a collaboration between only two individuals, whose love for the music they create pours out from every riff and melody on the album. ‘Bluff’ is a product of hard work and deep affection for the music and any true fan of quality will be quick to realize the album’s inherent virtues.\n\n1.  Decrepit - 0:00\n2.  Sunseeker - 3:41\n3.  Spoon Bender - 6:54\n4.  Hitchhiker - 9:59\n5.  Eye of Horus - 13:10\n6.  The Path - 16:35\n7.  Lost Eden - 20:02\n8.  Procrastinated - 23:22\n9.  Bluff - 26:22\n10. Moonrock - 30:42\n11. Depths - 34:04\n\nSupport Oddplay by purchasing the album here https://oddplay.bandcamp.com/album/bluff\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OddplayOfficial\n\nIf you appreciate this channel, please consider becoming a Patron.

            "description": "Five the Hierophant - Through Aureate Void (Full Album) Through Aureate Void offers a transient glimpse into realms unknown. Radical, bestriding, and at times even maniacal, Five the Hierophant have once again torn the fabrics of musical rule asunder on their spellbinding second album. For the uninitiated, Five the Hierophant are a London-based instrumental cabal that occupy an unearthly plateau, on which they routinely defy and dismantle the already elusive conventions of experimental metal. With their eclectic melange of blackened post-metal, jazz, drone, and psychedelia, they are one of the UK’s most intriguing and incomparable exports.\n\nHailing from within the gloomy cavities of the big smoke, the band’s oeuvre is appropriately dense and miasmatic, and their latest offering is a compelling expansion on their hypnotic debut, Over Phlegethon. Across five distinct vistas, the band traverses bleak and disturbing atmospheres with a metamorphosing grandeur, often heavy, and always exhilarating. Immediately, “Leaf in the Current” initiates the album with a mesmeric charisma, utilizing a rhythmic jazz-doom crux as a backdrop to the sensually phrased saxophonic voice. No sooner than the track has begun, the peculiar rhythms and barrier-tearing instrumentations establish the album as a characteristically eccentric collision of musical stripes. \n\nOn “Through Aureate Void” they go in an even more psychedelic direction, without losing any of the heaviness or darkness. Also, the use of untraditional instruments like saxophone, music saw, zither and a wide range of percussions, Five the Hierophant creates a totally unique soundscape which you won’t find anywhere else. \n\nRead full review by Nick Gosling here https://everythingisnoise.net/reviews/five-the-hierophant-through-aureate-void/\n\n1.  Leaf In The Current - 0:00\n2.  Fire From Frozen Cloud - 12:20\n3.  Berceuse - 20:25\n4.  Pale Flare Over Marshes - 28:31\n5.

            "description": "Daliborovo Granje - Hainin (Full Album) Daliborovo Granje are a 4 man psychedelic/experimental/post rock band from the Međimurje county in Croatia formed in 2014. The name of the band is a Croatian term meaning Dalibor's Branches – Dalibor being a common Croatian name, and branches as in tree branches. \n\nThe band strictly plays instrumental music, which is heavily influenced by various world music melodies (oriental, balkan…) combined into the standard post-rock / psychedelic rock genre, with the addition of various other genres like surf rock or stoner rock, although they don't like to be put in boxes/categories and just want to play the music they feel like playing at the moment. Jams are also a very big part of their musical everyday life, many of which have been uploaded to Youtube, and a lot of their songs come from jams which are later modified and exactly rehearsed.\n\nIn 2015 they released a self titled debut studio album (Daliborovo Granje 2015) which they recorded and mixed by themselves in a mystic garage in the suburbs of their hometown Čakovec. The band's philosophy and aspiration has always been towards independence – in playing, recording, mixing, mastering and creating artwork. The second studio album released in November 2020, titled Hainin (a serbian word meaning traitor or renegade) was also recorded by the band in 2019, although they were forced to abbandon their mystic garage and move to a new location - a magic barrack. This time the mix and master was left in the good hands of Leonard Klaić, who upgraded the sound from their first album.\n\n1.  Mehana - 0:00\n2.  Ak-maknadi - 7:24\n3.  Hainin - 11:15\n4.  Izgubljena - 15:37\n5.  Žal - 21:03\n6.  Sjenka u Mehani - 25:17\n7.  Na putu za Stakleni Grad - 29:40\n8.  Kača - 34:44\n9.

Everything is covered with the characteristic and strong female voice, which glides, hypnotizes and above all refines the multicoloured musical picture even more. The musical starting point is Heavy Psychedelic Rock - a musical journey into the cosmos inside ourselves - from 70's psychedelic rock through stoner, desert, space, blues, progressive, acid, kraut, jazz to grunge and doom.\n\n1.  Blood Moon - 0:00\n2.  Frightful Pain - 10:03\n3.  December Bloom - 15:00\n4.  Electric Black - 21:03\n5.

Put that all in a pot and let it simmer, and you get a heavy desert dance party hidden in the hills, while your mom is calling you demanding you to come home. But you won't go home. You're going to party with LAZERBEAM.  Sno Burn is the 2nd single from the upcoming debut album which will be released in April.\n\nThis is about the little devil on your shoulder telling you to do bad things...\n\nlyrics:\n\nSlow down whats your mission man\n\nI’ve got an itch and I need some scratch\nAn odd Job for this working man\nAn average man and I’m far from that\nFor times sake man lets get down a plan\nYou pour the gasoline and I’ll strike the match\nAcross the slush of petroleum land\nIgnition from a flick of the hand\n \nSo burn yeah burn\nYeah burn your sorry life down to the ground\nYeah burn fucking burn a stupid memory to the ground\n \nSaid slow down man and catch up your breath\nAt any moment now innocence can slip\nA clean slate on these working hands\nAnd black tar on the other hand\nA sly eye sees a shopping spree\nCapital murder in the first degree\nSaid stop here cause I want you to bleed\nAll of your knowledge right back into me\n \nSo burn yeah burn\nYeah burn your sorry life down to the ground\nYeah burn fucking burn a stupid memory to the ground\n \nA relegated case of larceny\n10 cases of assault and battery\n3 counts attempted armed robbery\nCapital murder in the first degree\nThese are the charges as presented to me\n \nSo burn yeah burn\nYeah burn your sorry life down to the ground\nYeah burn yeah burn a stupid memory to the ground\n\n\nSupport Lazer Beam by purchasing the single here https://lazerbeam.bandcamp.com/track/sno-burn-2\n\nSpotify https://open.spotify.com/artist/5uA720BQdCjVm43ksh4es4?si=aIj4VfbgTSmgwbiXF5v3bA&nd=1\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/LAZERBEAMLCF",

            "description": "Victor's Rampage - Infinite Elbow (Full Album) After years of silence, two of the founding members of \"Enochian Theory\" have finally returned with a brand new studio project \"Victor's Rampage\".  Not only are they armed with completely new music, they return with the same DIY attitude they started their journey with.  The English duo insisted on working without influence from outside pressures or expectations, so their new creative outlet was kept in secrecy until they were ready to release any material. Final production took place throughout 2020 at Shaun’s recording studio (SDR Audio Production), making a record completely by themselves, exactly how they wanted to, with full control of the whole process from start to finish.\n\nWith the sound of the production they wanted to capture the warmth, smoothness and dynamics of some of the big records made in the late 80’s and 90’s, but with the clarity of music made today.  \"Victor’s Rampage\" present their first creation as a fruitful blend of hard hitting Alternative Rock/Metal, drenched in head nodding grooves, fused together with a smooth experimental progressive edge.  The debut 25 minute mini album titled “Infinite Elbow” was released in October 2020.  Available on all Digital platforms, plus limited CD and Vinyl editions directly from the bands store.\n\n1.

            "description": "Black Death Wish - Black Death Wish (Full Album) The inspiration for Black Death Wish is a quote from Welsh poet Jeuan Gethin describing his death from the Bubonic Plague in 1349. Descending like smoke into our mist, for this pain I did not wish...  More inspiration comes from Edgar Allan Poe, Black Sabbath and the Beatles. Growing up in Birmingham Alabama in a family of steelworkers and coal miners, living in the shadow of the smoke belching steel mills, gave an affinity and deep appreciation of Black Sabbaths' dark heavy music. 70’s AM radio gave a love of melody and harmony. Five years of writing and recording were distilled during a summer of COVID induced isolation. BDW uses old, tuned-down Gibson guitars, vintage fuzz tones, Fender and Orange amps and a dash of melody to build a classic heavy sound….What sin did I do to meet this fate. Black is my soul, now full of hate. Black Death Wish.\n\n1.  1348 - 0:00\n2.  Black Death Wish - 0:39\n3.  Storm Come Rolling In - 5:31\n4.  Drowning - 10:23\n5.  I Am Death - 14:25\n6.

            "description": "Valle Galgo - Despertar (Full EP) Hailing from Argentina, Valle Galgo combines heavy stoner rock with hardcore and adds in a combination of psychedelic and sludge vocals to create a truly unique and captivating sound.  These songs have elements of grunge and heavy rock, but just when you think you have them figured out, they kick it high gear with supersonic guitars and sludge singing. When a debut EP leaves you wanting more, you know the band is onto something good. Valle Galgo definitely leaves you wanting more!\n\nReview by Fuzzy Cracklins https://www.fuzzycracklins.com/2020/04/valle-galgo.html\n\n1.  Valle Galgo - 0:00\n2.  No te escuchas - 6:53\n3.

            "description": "The Cosmic Trip Advisors - Same, same…but different (Full Album) The Cosmic Trip Advisors hail from West Lothian in Scotland and are a rock ’n’ roll band with a heart of soul. Rock ’n’ Soul, if you will.  Same, same...but different is a live studio performance of Wrong again, Albert... In a world before the Apocalypse, when bands could meet of an evening in dark fragrant rooms, strewn with crumpled beer cans and ashtrays, overflowing with the charred remains of epic jams and goofy grins, The Cosmic Trip Advisors assembled. There was little purpose to their gathering, it was just another rehearsal. But the vibes were good, the creative cogs were lubricated and somebody remembered to press the big red record button. And with that simple flick of a switch, this album was born.\n\nIt’s a bit loosey. It’s a bit goosey. It’s occasionally a wee bit out of tuney. More importantly, it’s a joyous, swaggering romp through the entire “Wrong again, Albert…” album. There are no 2nd takes, safety nets, overdubs or sneaky cheats. This is what the album would have sounded like if it was recorded at a keg party in an hour with six months more rehearsal under our belt. The icing on the cake is Lesley’s incendiary vocal performance throughout. If you loved her singing on “Wrong again, Albert…”, just wait until you hear what she’s pulled out of the bag this time. This is the debut album’s unintentionally saucy little sister. You know, the dirty one you wish you’d met first. In short, it’s same, same...but different. \n\n1.  Oh My My My! - 0:00\n2.  Sleazy Does It - 9:30\n3.  Lonely Since I Met Ya - 13:24\n4.  Had To Have It - 16:48\n5.  Feeling Low - 20:05\n6.  Such Is Life - 24:24\n7.  Ledz Boogie - 28:11\n8.  I Got It Going On - 31:31\n9.

            "description": "Sam Pace and the Gilded Grit - Rapture (Full Album) Sam Pace and the Gilded Grit is an American Rock n’ Roll band from Austin, TX.  Sam Pace and the Gilded Grit’s album Rapture is full of raw power. The overall sound ranges from blues to monster rock to moments of deep tenderness. Influenced by blues, soul, roots, rock and reggae- the music grounds itself in groove, tenacity and feel. Sam Pace and the Gilded Grit have been making a name for themselves as a force to be reckoned with since their inception in 2011. As staples in the Austin music scene and road dogs famous for their relentless 50-city U.S. Tours- the band has an old school work ethic with the chops to match.\n\nSam’s voice and guitar playing are the signatures of the sound. His booming baritone and soulful growl give the music a powerful edge; while his heavy, swinging guitar and thick, luscious tone has been described as “a marriage between Peter Green, early Clapton, and early Hendrix\". Down and dirty rock n’ roll is hard to come by these days, even more difficult for it to achieve the level of success Pace has.\n\n1.  Two White Horses - 0:00\n2.  Get the Evil Out - 7:25\n3.

            "description": "Zoe - Back Into The Light (Full Album) Zoe are back into the light! Back Into The Light, their 4th album, is still rock n roll!  The 10 tracks are in the usual stoner vein of the French quartet. Back Into The Light, Voices, By Your Side and White Trash are good examples. Others are more psych, flirting with the 70’s ambiance of MC5, Stooges and Led Zeppelin: Wild Wild City, Down In A Hole, and Go Like A Bomb. In short, a complete album for the powerful rock aficionados!  The sound is big, the songs are bad ass, mean and the four are on top of their game. Hard rock is their trade, stoner rock their profession and speedy fun their adagio. And then they change it up with a bit more seventies touches, bluesy influences or incredibly addictive riffs.\n\n1.  Back Into The Light - 0:00\n2.  Voices - 3:42\n3.  Down In A Hole - 8:03\n4.  In Praise Of Laziness - 13:11\n5.  Go Like A Bomb - 16:37\n6.  By Your Side - 19:58\n7.  White Trash - 25:21\n8.  Wild Wild City - 29:54\n9.  Band Of Brothers - 34:32\n10. Cut Class - 37:53\n\nSupport Zoe by purchasing the album here https://zoestonerrock.bandcamp.com/album/back-into-the-light-lx-brennus-music\n\nIf you appreciate this channel, please consider becoming a Patron.

            "description": "Ananda Mida - Anodnatius (Full Album) Ananda Mida is stoner rock and psychedelia collective, lead by Max Ear, drummer of OJM and co-founder of Go Down Records, and Matteo Pablo Scolaro, underground guitarist and curator of Go Down Bands on Tour, with the help of Eeviac artworks. Since 2015, they have been playing, with different line-ups, from three up to six members, a seventies sound mixed with desert and psychedelia grooves.  \n\nThe first of a 2 part suite, these Italians show their lighter, quirky side especially on tracks such as 'Ors' and the excellent 'Anulios' creating fiery desert rock with blues and psych influences. 'Passavas' too, reminds of Fatso Jetson with its excellent surf and psychedelic lead guitar lines. Their style is clever, eclectic and distinctive, they don't use obvious hooks to pull the listener in and at times they come off as quite odd, but repeated listens reveals a record of hidden depths.\n\n1.  Aktavas - 0:00\n2.  Lunia - 3:42\n3.  Kondur - 8:17\n4.  Anulios - 13:27\n5.  Passavas - 19:14\n6.  Ors - 24:14\n7.  Askokinn - 28:22\n8.  Heropas - 32:27\n9.

            "description": "Appalooza - The Holy Of Holies (Full Album) Appalooza is a long-gone stallion speeding after a lost freedom. Formed in France in 2012, the trio takes its cue from the alt-heavy firepower of Alice in Chains, as well as the rock'n'roll stampede of the likes of Queens of the Stone Age or Them Crooked Vultures, propelling themselves with a creativity and sense of direction that are the essence of great bands. The Holy Of Holies is their new sophomore full length album. Appalooza are the tightest rock band in a long time, rocking so hard in a sort of piston-firing fashion, and when the atmosphere starts to thicken, they lose none of their focus, with a vocalist who can go from beefy and smooth, to an asphalt-ripping howl that would turn Kurt Cobain's head. \n\nThe Holy Of Holies is an irony of religion. A storm’s coming and sends the Human Kind to a certain death. The absence of god on earth sends men back alone. They are deprived and punished by their individualism and appear already dead. They accept and seek a new being to venerate and send right through the desert all their sins on a scapegoat to find the demon Azazael, the Holy of Holies. This fallen angel takes possession of mankind. He reincarnates them into a half man half beast species by transplanting a horse skull, symbol of a lost freedom.\n\n1.  Storm - 0:00\n2.  Snake Charmer - 5:14\n3.  Reincarnation - 10:02\n4.  Nazareth - 15:33\n5.  Conquest - 20:15\n6.  Azazael - 27:56\n7.  Distress - 34:42\n8.  Thousand Years After - 40:03\n9.

            "description": "First Nation - Baraka (Full Album) First Nation is a band composing Post/Experimental/Noise Rock music, founded in 2014 by Berkcan Simsek(Drums) and Metehan Erdogan(Guitars). They started this band to show the stories they created within themselves. The duo met with each other in their previous bands \"Seraf\" and \"Mary Jane Hits\" After they quit those bands, First Nation's improvements accelerated really quick. They improved their years-long compositions and also worked on new ones. Early times of the band were mostly spent doing some rituals to show their inner troubles, and those rituals are the main source of First Nation's creativity.\n\n“Baraka” includes five years of preparation and two years of recording. In this album, First Nation tried to design their lives’ process as a desert journey. They aligned their songs with their journey and the flow of the changing dynamics. With these songs, they try to reflect that journey’s arrival as Baraka.\n\n1.  Saplantı - 0:00\n2.  Yok - 10:29\n3.  Nevmit - 18:49\n4.  Yıkım - 26:42\n5.  Hiç - 34:03\n6.

            "description": "Falcon Haptics - Run to the Sky (Full Album) Falcon Haptics are Space grade scuzz rock from Colorado. The Denver outfit offers up eight tracks of space haze on its debut record, Run to the Sky. Once you hear it, you'll say, \"Yeah, the name fits,\" but you won't exactly know why.  The record pays homage to metal, but also desert rock and math rock. Singer and guitarist Nathaniel Marshall’s voice recalls Maynard Keenan if he possessed Dexter Holland's body and forced him to start a doom-metal band that couldn’t stop giggling.\n\nThe fuzzy, medium-tempo songs occasionally segue violently into short bursts of crossover thrash- or death- and even black-metal territory. The music is reminiscent of punk bands like NOFX, who toss random reggae parts into furious melodic hardcore songs. Even when the tracks veer wildly from intoxicated grooves into furious blast beats, it’s kind of funny rather than jarring. The production carries a punk-rock ethos with it, but the music is also technical, the work of people who know what they're doing.  \n\nRead the full review here https://www.westword.com/music/falcon-haptics-gets-ready-to-release-run-to-the-sky-11803281\n\n1.  Wolf King - 0:00\n2.  Thy Horror Sonic - 6:12\n3.  Run to the Sky - 11:41\n4.  Without You - 16:16\n5.  Space Castle - 23:01\n6.  Conjuring - 30:20\n7.  Fable - 35:58\n8.

The seven tracks on this record\nreally blow the sand from the dunes to the face of the listener. The\npower trio creates a varied and layered sound that makes the nerve\nendings vibrate. The group’s desert rock groove seems to slide like\non rails despite its grandeur. Hypnotic sounds, evocative atmospheres and emphatic rhythms that have strongly inspired musicians and\nlisteners from all over the world.\n====\nGo Down Records\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GoDownRecords/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/godownrecords/\nhttps://www.godownrecords.com/\n====\nSIDE A\n1.

            "description": "Devastating Light is a DIY post metal/doom/sludge band from Tampere, Finland. Everything is\nplayed, recorded, mixed and mastered by Teemu Toikka, who is a seasoned veteran of the ug\npunk -scene in Finland. Devastating Light has stories to tell and the stories are all about the pain\nof existence in our modern time, mental health issues and the effect that has on a person and\npeople around them.\n''I have already failed you'' is a theme album about a man suffering from depression and becoming a\nfather while the world is ending around him. It explores feelings of not being or doing enough and\nthe fear of somehow passing on the disease to the child. Is it even right to bring a child into this\nworld that is slowly ending?\nThe music is heavy in every way possible, sonically, expressively and thematically. The crushing\nguitars, slow beats and the distant screams create a bleak voyage to the deepest parts of the\nmind where you can find no escape from the pain and despair. This is the world we have to live in\nand it is not a pretty place. This is how I feel and there is not much I can do about it.\nThis projects birth felt like an absolute necessity. The name Devastating Light describes how your\ndepression seems to get worse at certain times of the year. In the fall when it get darker and the is\nalmost no sunlight during the day it makes sense that you get more depressed. But during the\nspring the days get a lot lighter and somehow that seem to make the depression even worse. So\nwhen does it get better then? One of the songs states: ”the dark consumes me, the light destroys\nme”.\nMusical influences include Neurosis, Old Man Gloom, Amenra, Cult of Luna, Envy and Swans.\n\npre-order album at: https://planetkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/devastating-light-i-have-already-failed-you\n====\nPlanet K Records  \nhttps://www.planetkrecords.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/planetkrecords\nTel.+393312724732\nplanetkrecords@gmail.com",

Trying to win the race\n 'Cause you think you got something to prove \nStick on, be in the game You never give a damn; give a damn\n 'Cause you got it all covered \nQuiet makes you feel safe You're running again \nYou got to give a damn; give a damn Beside yourself! \nYou lie in a coffin Of carefully polished wood Being stated \nEverything is good You rent time and always \nTo swallow what you bear You sit down and stare! \n====\nEngineered and mixed by Giorgos Kasapidis \nMarinos Tzaferis - Guitar Nikos Manikiotis - Vocals Savvas Kalymnios - Drums Pavlos Gasp - Bass",

After 19 albums, this is the culmination of the vision Jakob Rehlinger has had for the psychedelic spacerock project since the first Heavy Moon release in 2006. Blending classic late ‘60s acid rock with early ‘70s prog, krautrock, and proto-metal, he’s woven a sonic tapestry of trippy, mind-bending sounds and textures to aid the listener in their own astral travels. No additional psychedelics needed.\ncredits\nreleased February 21, 2021\n\nWritten, performed, recorded, mixed and mastered by\nJakob Rehlinger at AUX13, New Toronto, September - October 2020\n\nGear: Fender Telecaster, Tanglewood TW73, Fender Precision Bass, Zoom MS-60B, Zoom MS-50G, Zoom MS-70CDR, Dunlop Crybaby Wah, ElectroHarmonix Mel9, Yamaha Reface CP, Yamaha Reface YC, Behringer Model D, Roland TD-6V drums.",

With a mutual worship for Black Sabbath, the band was created by guitarist Baptiste Pozzi (Ex-Lord Humungus) and drummer Baptiste Reig (DST, Frank Sabbath, Aven) out of the ashes of Pozzi’s former doom band, later joined by bassist Thom Dezelus (Carpet Burns). After the first lockdown, the feverous trio delivered a 1st 25mn eponym EP recorded live in the womb of La Baleine (a multidisciplinary art warehouse) by Pablo Saguez at the Studio Blow and Mastered by Cyril Messon from French Psych band Noyades.\n\nCerbère recorded 3 tracks wreaked with the scent of bad tripping catacombes sludge, crossed with humming noise drones from their cracked up amps. Opening on an Abbath inspirational statement, gut driven guitars weave with heavy drum breaks and thick & vile basselines.\n\nAs a hellish three headed hound, blackened chants invoque obscure French lyrics and combine 70’s Heavy proto doom filthened with angst and malevolence.The band trips out at heavy volume on the influence of bands such as Iron Monkey, Ramesses and The Melvins.\"\n====\n01\nJulia 00:00\n02\nAliéné     05:24\n03\nCerbère    09:18",

            "description": "“Dance Upon the Dead” comes from Discarded Self’s upcoming self-titled album, due out on April 30th via Sarcophagus Recordings. The album was recorded at Doom Tomb Studios in Lloydminster, Alberta Canada.\n\nJarret Beach, the person behind the one-man-band that is Discarded Self has this to say about the song “Dance Upon the Dead”:\n“I’ve been watching a lot of serial killer movies for I don’t know, the last 25 years haha. I used those types of films for the inspiration of this song. This song was written coming from the perspective of a husband or father of a victim of a serial killer. It is clearly a revenge song, and describes the hate and rage that would be felt by the families of the victims. It’s a disgusting dive into that reality, and ends in a way that quenches the thirst of pure revenge.”\n\nFlooding forth with misery and hate comes the first album from Discarded Self, the Canadian solo project from Jarret “Fuzzgod” Beach, who’s also a member of the bands Destroy My Brains and Ashes of Yggdrasil. Created during a time of personal isolation, the album “Discarded Self” ranges from tales of the macabre to introspective trips into self-loathing and personal degradation that dredge up terrible memories of the past to drown in personal regret. There is no hope for the future here.\n\nPre-orders through the bands Bandcamp page are available now, with other pre-orders opening soon through iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, Napster, Deezer, Tik Tok and Tidal\n\n\nDiscarded Self social media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/discardedself\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sludge_worshipper/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk4FrLKTuJL04pz2Eu9IfoA/featured?view_as=subscriber\n\nFollow Sarcophagus Recordings on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Sarcophagus-Recordings-107103174546426\n\nDoom Tomb Recording Studio in Alberta, Canada - https://www.facebook.com/DoomTombRecodingStudio/",

An ominous and dramatic feel combined with memorable melodies and clean vocals are the pillars of this album’s atmosphere. Experimenting with heaviness and depth of sound the band strived to surpass anything you heard before, but at the same time preserve the vintage and \"old-school\" feel. Anyone will find something to their liking: heavy fuzz riffs, melodic lines and choruses to sing along.\n\nMark Davydov - Guitar, Vocals\nDenis Chelnokov - Bass\nDenis Sulimkin - Drums, Synths\n\nRecorded at DTH Studios, Moscow, Russia\nDanila Gerasimov - Master of Sound\n\nArtwork: Denis Chelnokov\n\nVinyl Visualizer by https://www.instagram.com/macabro.studio/ contact him",

The Italian fuzzmongers mark 10 years of cooperative corporeal existence in 2020 and last checked in from their native Savona in Summer 2018 with the aptly-titled Cosmic Blues, and two years and an entire lifetime later they're back with another collection of classic-minded heavy groovers, picking the best the '70s, '90s and '10s had to offer in riffery and melding spacey blowouts with desert-hued hooks.\n\nSeven Swords is the second LP Black Elephant have issued in league with Detroit-based imprint Small Stone Records, and whether it's the scorching leads of \"Yayoi Kusama\" or the conscious wink-and-nod of \"Red Sun and Blues Sun\" a short time later -- just ahead of the bluesy \"Seppuku\" and the near-nine-minute stretch of closer \"Govinda\" -- the four-piece bring their finest work to-date in an efficient seven-track/33-minute stretch, building not only on what they accomplished on Cosmic Blues, but also what their prior two full-lengths, 2014ís Bifolchi Inside and 2012ís Spaghetti Cowboys, were building toward. This is a band coming into their own, wasting neither their time or yours in the process.\n\nFuzz pedals preach on, the sky cracks, and the riffs themselves seem to lock bellies in sumo battles, so what the hell?

            "description": "Band: Bulbous Creation\n\nAlbum: You Won't Remember Dying\n\nRelease Date: 1970\n\nCounrty: USA\n\nType/Genre: Heavy Psychedelic Rock\n\nAlbum Tracklist:\n\n01. End Of The Page\n\n02. Having A Good Time\n\n03. Satan\n\n04. Fever Machine Man\n\n05. Let's Go To The Sea\n\n06. Hooked\n\n07. Under The Black Sun\n\n08. Stormy Monday\n\nAn extremely rare and previously unreleased 1969/1970 heavy psychedelic album housed in a superb sleeve. It was recorded in the Cavern Sound Studio, Missouri. The opening cut, \"End Of The Page\", has a lovely guitar intro and the other highlight is the lengthy \"Let's Go To The Sea\", which features some great Hendrix's psychedelic guitar work. The remainder of the album comprises harder edged rock cuts, their own interpretation of \"Stormy Monday\" and \"Hooked\", which is the best moment on the album vocally. Worth checking out. The band hailed from the Kansas/Missouri area.\nHeavy psych classic with warm dusty basement sound with HEAVY bass and great acid psych guitarwork of premium quality. \"Stormy Monday\" and \"Let's Go To The Sea\" are amazing.\nHighly recommended!",

This collection of tracks by the studio group Thundermother (reissued by Kissing Spell records) was apparently recorded in 1970-1971 in Wakefield, England and engineered and produced by Mike Levon. It collects their contributions to Astral Navigations, Gagalactyca, Loose Routes I and II.\n\"David J. Smith (formerly of David John and the Mood) co-produced and sang on some tracks of an \"ad hoc\" group (i. e. they were a studio creation) called Thundermother during 1969. This band shared one lp with Lightyears Away called \"Astral Navigations\" (Holyground 1971). Thundermother's contribution was recorded over one weekend.\"\n\nDavid John - Lead Vocals/Backing Vocals\nFrank Newbould Backing - Vocals/Bass/Guitars\nGinner(Dave Millen) - Lean and Acid Guitars/Vocals/Guitars\nDaz(Dave Smith) - Bass\nJerusalem Smith - Drums on 'Woman'\nDave Wilkinson - Piano",

They moved to Britain in the late 60's, and got a contract with Philips. They were also joined by several British members and released a couple of albums. \"Kappa\" from 1971 reveals a band in the heavy-progressive vein and with a thing for lengthy jams and improvisations. This is especially apparent on the instrumental 22-minute \"King Riff and Snow Flakes\" that takes up the whole of side 2. Heavy guitar and organ dominates the sound, and literally every musician in the group is allowed to stretch out. The first side is a lot more structured and song-oriented, although the 10-minute opener \"Trauma\" also features lengthy improvisations. \"Same Old Reason\" is a strong tune with harpsichord and nice themes. The ballad \"Daredatta\" is sung in Japanese and dominated by the flute of Miki Curtis. \"Vision of Tomorrow\" is a straightforward and traditional 70's hard rock song. Overall, quite solid and enjoyable stuff if you're into early 70's heavy progressive rock with lengthy solos and instrumental passages. \nhttp://www.vintageprog.com/sss.htm\n\nSamurai – a Japanese group led by vocalist/flautist Miki Curtis. They went to Europe in late 1967, picking up some European members and thus becoming half-Japanese. In London they recorded a single and their debut album, the double-LP [so I’m told] ‘Samurai’ a.k.a. ‘Miki Curtis & Samurai’ [German Metronome, 1970], as well as a single only released in Italy. They should not be confused with the UK group of the same name, who released a self-titled LP on Greenwich in 1971.\n\nTheir second album, ‘Green Tea’ [Philips, 1970], is as far as I can tell simply a single-LP repackaging of the debut only released in Japan, to where the band had returned. The last album that I know of is ‘Kappa’ [Philips, 1971]. The band played a varied kind of psychedelic progressive rock, occasionally a bit hard-rocking, with jazzy and exotic Asian touches. They’ve been compared by Vernon Joyson to Andwella’s Dream and early Traffic. The music on their first album [the only one I’ve heard] is fairly accessible, but without at all sacrificing quality or creativity. On ‘Kappa’ they reputedly played lengthier tracks with more of a heavy progressive leaning. ‘Samurai’/’Green Tea’ [single LP version] was reissued on CD by P-Vine. The bass player, Tetsu Yamauchi, was later in Friends [see above], Free and The Faces, as well as pursuing a brief solo career. Drummer Yujin Harada was later in the last incarnation of Far East Family Band [see above]. Graham Smith, credited on harmonica on the first 2 albums, is probably the same person who later played violin in String Driven Thing and Van Der Graaf.\nhttp://www.recordheaven.net/japan.htm",

Richards*\n\n\nRoad was an American hard rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1970. Comprising bassist/vocalist Noel Redding (previously of The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Fat Mattress), guitarist/vocalist Rod Richards (formerly of Rare Earth) and drummer/vocalist Leslie Sampson, the band released one album, Road, in 1972. The band is no relation to the Dutch band Road active at the same time with \"Never Leave Me Lonely\" 1971. Road was formed in 1970, after Redding left Fat Mattress and Richards left Rare Earth. The band recorded their self-titled album at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California in 1972, the album was released later in the year before the group disbanded. In the brief time they were together, Redding and Sampson participated in the jam sessions that resulted in Randy California's 1972 Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds album. Following Road, Redding and Sampson formed The Noel Redding Band, while Richards went on to a solo career. Sampson also joined Stray Dog, played in The Gas in the early 80s and Sally Barker And The Rhythm and The Pirates in the 90s.\n\nBand members\nNoel Redding – bass, vocals\nRod Richards – guitar, vocals\nLeslie Sampson – drums, vocals\n\n\nFAIR USE\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Farm so impressed Canned Heat's manager at the time, he offered to represent them, but the band turned him down. Sadly, Farm disbanded about a year after their debut album was released.\n~ by RYM.\n\n- Del Herbert - lead guitar, 12-string acoustic guitar\n- Gary Gordon - 2nd guitar, bottleneck guitar, vocals\n- Jim Elwyn - bass, vocals\n- Steve Evanchik - congas, timbales, cymbals, mouth harp\n- Roger Greenwalt - organ, piano\n- Mike Young - drums",

The \"Joseph\" in the band is Joseph Longeria, a blues singer/guitarist who was playing the Texas blues-bar circuit in the late '60s. He was discovered by producer/A&R man Steve Tyrell. Longeria was signed to Scepter Records, and went to work. Longeria had song titles, but no actual songs. Him, the rest of his band and the producers wrote music and lyrics to go with all the titles, and recorded the album in a mere 48 hours. Joseph never had a hit, and never released anything after this. This album is very rare, and is unknown among common society.\n\nSongs:\n1. Trick Bag\n2. I Ain't Flattenin' No More Frogs For Snakes\n3. Cold Biscuits and Fish Heads\n4. Stoned Age Man\n5. I'm Gonna Build a Mountain\n6. Mojo Gumbo\n7. The House of the Rising Sun\n8. Gotta Get Away\n9. Come the Sun Tomorrow\n\nEnjoy!",

Their only album shows the top-grade musical quality, creativity and inventivity making a hard rock fulfilled of acid and psychedelic approaches, driven by still uncommon distortions for those times and an intensity quite similar to stoner rock bands. The band, therefore, decided in a then \"state-of-the-art\" 16-track studio facility in London with the latest sound technology available. Curiously, the album was only released in the United States by Bell Records through a certain Adrian Miller, who pretended to be the band's producer and without any band members' consent! Miller was who in fact secretly suggest the real bands's producer to change their name to Orang-Utan, even if they kept going on under the name Hunter - after an Albert King's song - until their last days. The guitarrist Sid Fairman wasn't ever credited, once that he left the band shortly after the album recording. At the end of everything, here's the example of a talented band which could have been very sucessful, which sadly was surrounded with some wrong people who managed to make everything go down the drain.",

Produced over a period of two years by Stu Cook, from Creedence Clearwater Revival, it's a masterful collection of songs about zombies, demons, vampires and, yes, even the \"Creature With The Atom Brain\". These tracks, inspired by schlock sci-fi and horror movies and colored by Roky's distinctive, high-pitched vocal and squealing guitar, are among the maverick performer's best.\n© 2013 Light In The Attic Records\n℗ 2013 Light In The Attic Records",

The group never performed under the name Dragonfly, supposedly just the album title here only. Somehow well after the band had broken up and on subsequent reissues, Dragonfly has stuck as an alias for the band.\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n\"Indian Summer\"\n\n\"There was never really a band by the name of Dragonfly, and no gig was ever played under that name. Dragonfly was was just an album. The story goes on from here. A guy from Durango, Colorado, by the name of Gerry Jimerfield, had a band called The Lords of London. Of course none of them were British but it sounded good during the days of the British Invasion. Gerry was twenty-six and the others were nineteen and twenty. Gerry had already been in the military and had taken a rock band to LA, made a couple of records, and played on the TV show Hullabaloo. The band business in LA being what it was, Gerry moved back to Durango and stayed at his parent's kitchenette motel.\" .... \nAmazing story! ❤&☮ forever🌺\nhttp://therockasteria.blogspot.de/2014/03/dragonfly-dragonfly-1968-us-tremendous.html",

            "description": "Second album from this groundbreaking group, this album is almost better known for its buttocks artwork than the wild music on the vinyl. The almost instrumental trio (drummer Neumeier struts out some weird vocals once in a blue moon) is still just as crazy and free from all commercial considerations, and even if the music on the album has not aged well, the album's historical worth is certainly indisputable and the Konrad Plank production and its release on the legendary Ohr label adds even more to its legend .\nThis is more of a free jam with four tracks all around the 10min+ mark that have no real structure or constraint or restrictions (except the one of not having any ;-), so a good bunch of progheads will most likely frown at this album the ones that bookend it. But the double guru chose theirs and they clearly announce the colour by flashing their guitar power trio based on its ultimate form: the Jimi Hendrix Experience. But overall compared to their UFO debut album, this album is more structured (if you can call it that ;-), a tad less anarchic and a bit calmer. But don't be fooled: this still complete and utter chaos. YUMMMY!!!!!!!\nElectric Junk (rather aptly titled is always on the verge of complete chaos while coming from pure mystic Hendrix-esque moments to a free jazz and utter spacey nightmares with feedbacks included. A pure joy to hear, if you ask me. And this apocalyptic atmosphere is only after the first track, and there are three left, so you'd better attach the safety belt and ask your buddies fasten the strap of your loony bin costume, cos you're in for a completely mind-boggling ride, starting with the meaningful Meaning Of Meaning. This 12-min freak out is probably one of the best examples to show what kind of freedom Guru Guru enjoyed during that blessed period of the very early 70's. with even less of a structure (if you except Mani Neumeier's incredible drum works) Genrish is free to go explore what good ol'Jimi was out to explore in some of his wildest jams.\nOn the next slice, the group visits another black guitar rock legend, Bo Diddley, and pay him an incredible tribute, even if I always wondered how the old master appreciated his works being trampled destroyed and rebuilt, not always successfully either, as this track is maybe the slightly weaker one, because there some evident lengths. The closing Spaceships starts out understandably on spacey sounds, which can be closer to Popol Vuh's Affenstunde or TD's Zeit period, even if they remained the guitar trio without synths or other keyboards. Rather impressive, slightly fascinating but definitely not out fully unscathed. All hail to the double Guru. for the faint-hearted.\nYes this album is clearly indebted to the great Jimi, but it is also a bit more than a glaring and blatant copy. One of those absolute statement on musical freedom, this is the type of album that had most parents and grandparents heaving in anguish for their offspring's sanity. And little did they know that they were fully right to be concerned, because no kid listening to this album would come out fully unscathed. All hail to the double Guru. \n\nSongs / Tracks Listing:\n\n1. Electric Junk (0:00)\n2. The Meaning Of Meaning (11:04)\n3. Bo Diddley (23:21)\n4.

            "description": "Low Fen - Low Fen (Full Album) Hailing from the small town of Lądek-Zdrój in the mountains of south western Poland, this quartet play instrumental stoner rock with trippy and suggestive elements. When done right, the way Low Fen does it, instrumental music is fantastic. They have structure to follow but they jam out mixed with brilliant solos in between and best of all, the guys allow the listener to create their own little world where you can cleanse, recharge and come back so much stronger.\n\nRead full review here https://outlawsofthesun.blogspot.com/2019/07/low-fen-st-album-review.html\n\n1.  23 - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Black Sky Giant - Planet Terror (Full Album) Black Sky Giant is a Stoner Rock band from Argentina. If you like your stoner music on the desert side of things, and instrumental, with a bit of psychedelic flair, then Black Sky Giant has just the album for you. \"Planet Terror\" is a collection of 7 songs with slow, fuzzy riffs with clean guitar solos that sound like they were recorded at the bottom of Death Valley. Add in some choice samples, with a dash of synths, and you have an album which will keep you mesmerized all the way through.  An invigorating, fresh take on the sounds of the cosmos. \n\nReview by Fuzzy Cracklins https://www.fuzzycracklins.com/2021/01/blackskygiant.html\n\n1.  Planet Terror - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Liquify - Illusionary Reality (Full Album) Liquify is a one-man hard psychedelic rock project from America.  Relax, lay back and embrace the Illusionary Reality. Feel the groove of the psychedelic stonerific riffs along with the trippy solos. Enter the dream world at the ivory castle and follow the crystal river flowing from the green sea and begin on your quest for eternity. Beware of the sleeping dragon who has been kept under Orion's spell. As you proceed, be weary of sunstroke as you reach the mighty desert. For the dream state will be as strange as that of a hallucinogen. In the skyline haze, you may see a glimpse of your dreams of beyond. Through the dawning wasteland you will trek but it will be there that you find who you really are. And it is then that your journey will be complete and you will truly understand...that reality is only illusionary.\n\n1.  Crystals Flow Forth From the Sea of Green - 0:00\n2.  Quest for Eternity - 8:56\n3.  Sleeping Dragon - 16:50\n4.  The Spell of Orion - 19:55\n5.  Sunstroke - 29:00\n6.  Hallucinogen - 33:06\n7.  Skyline Haze - 40:20\n8.  Dreams of Beyond - 47:00\n9.

            "description": "Oddplay - Urban Shades (Full Album) Oddplay are two guys (Itso Nikoloff and Alexander Enev) who share the vibe and love for psychedelic stoner rock. They are independent artists from Varna, Bulgaria who record, mix and master their instrumental music all by themselves.  Urban Shades is Oddplay's second studio album. It is a dark, psychedelic wonder perfect for a late-night drive or simply when you are in the mood for something heavy but sensual, melodic but odd.\n\nThe album is entirely instrumental, letting you savour every emphatic strum of the guitar and the groovy bass. Some tracks feel like bringing you into a cerebral psychedelic experience, while others convey the grit and tremor of something more old-school. Some of them may also feel kind of light-hearted and melodic, as if watching a beautiful sunset during the first day of a desolate apocalypse. This all makes for a very unique and cathartic listening experience as the album weaves each subsequent track into a wonderful malady of styles and vibes.\n\n1.  It's Always There - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "A Borrowing Kid Generation - Temple Of The Witch (Full Album) A Borrowing Kid Generation is a Stoner\\Rock\\Metal Band based in Athens, Greece. It's a one-man project by Nikos Raptis of Greece. He's been playing guitar for a long time and took up bass three years ago, and writes & records everything in his home studio with his wife and two kids nearby.  With all of the riffs and heavy vibes coming out of these tracks you might think this is a three or four person band. You won't be surprised to know the bands he enjoys include Kyuss, Black Sabbath, Corrosion Of Conformity, Fu Manchu, Nightstalker, AC/DC, Sleep, Orange Goblin, 1000mods ... ok you get the idea. If you are going to take inspiration, you might as well take it from the best.\n\nTemple Of The Witch was released in May, 2020.  These tracks are just straight-up high-riffage fuzzed-out stoner rock. Tons of energy, catchy grooves, and they carry a melody.  Tone terrific guitar drifts with confidence until drums realize whats going on then all hell breaks loose!! Riffs are fortified and skins are annihilated as this immense album grinds on.\n\nReview here https://www.fuzzycracklins.com/2018/10/a-borrowing-kid-generation.html\n\n1.  Rising Sun - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Yawning Man - Live At Giant Rock (Full Album) Influenced by everything from the psychedelic to the folkloric, jazz, hard rock, roots punk, world music- while hard to describe, one could say the sound and mood of Yawning Man is visual and cinematic , heavy and melancholy, driving & daydreamy...Yawning Man, who hail from the arid desert area of Southern California, have been playing, jamming, and recording since 1986, and are a highly influential band. Most of their fans and those heavily influenced by them consider them to be ‘the originators’ of the entire “Desert Rock” movement/genre.\n\nThroughout the instrumental cinematic rock landscapes of Yawning Man, the post-Ventures haunting melodies & composition of guitarist Gary Arce are constantly being stretched, up-ended and sent deep into dark Joy Division territory, by the weird chords and heavy bass grooves of Mario Lalli and drummer Bill Stinson. The result is the kind of brooding and thunderous atmosphere that draws you constantly inward. Yawning Man still is going strong, driven by that which initially inspired the original members thereof to begin this never ending journey, which was/is/will always be to create and connect landscapes of the real to surreal. The dreams to the drastic. The end and on-going result being the beautiful, swirling and other-worldly music you know as Yawning Man. And then some.\n\nA dream of the band for over 20 years. Finally this live cinematic concert experience has been realized. Bringing together the visuals of the unique, majestic and awe inspiring Giant Rock area of the Southern California Mojave desert with the music that these desert landscapes inspired. Intimately and beautifully captured in the environment that inspires Yawning Man’s spacious, expansive and cinematic music. Live At Giant Rock was filmed/recorded live on May 18th, 2020 in the visually stunning, mysterious landscape.  Yawning Man’s timely expression during the age of “social distancing\". No audience, just the band performing their sonic meditations in the rugged beauty of the Mojave Desert. \n\n1.  Tumbleweeds In The Snow - 0:00\n2.  The Last Summer Eye - 14:53\n3.

            "description": "Threestepstotheocean - Del Fuoco (Full Album)  Threestepstotheocean is an instrumental band born in Milan in 2006. Since then the group has released four albums, collaborating over time with several Italian and international labels and following a mainly DIY mode. Threestepstotheocean gathers elements of Metal, Post-Rock, and psychedelia, taking inspiration from a wide, complex kaleidoscope of sounds and feelings. New album “Del Fuoco” moves freely across the borders of instrumental rock, gathering elements from Metal and Post-Rock, blending them with psychedelia e world influences.  On their new album Del\nFuoco, the Italy-based post-rock group Threestepstotheocean has captured a majestically heavy portrait of soaring intensity.\n\nThe album, at moments like the consistently thundering riffs of “Del deserto,” feels regally powerful, but there’s an earthiness in the tones and a grounded vibe in many of the melodies that together keep the record somewhere that feels powerfully tangible. It’s as if the truly enlivening album captures a soundtrack to ocean waves breaking onto a shore, or — during some of its softer moments — a soundtrack for the moment when the sun breaks over the horizon and day begins.\n\nThe record gets quite heavy at times, like during the opening of “Profezie dalle rovine,” but there’s always a certainty-driven stability in the songs. The tracks never feel unwieldy; rather, the melodies coursing through the songs feel like they have been carefully crafted in order to deliver an accessible imprint of power like might be found in the natural world. Listening through the album feels like stumbling across some beautiful formation that has been crafted entirely by the metaphorical hand of nature. It’s as if, at the core of the record’s soundscapes, there’s some kind of beautiful seaside mountain, or some kind of majestically awe-inspiring selection of trees that have seen more between them than most entire generations of humans.\n\nAfter the grounded regality of “Del deserto,” the following song — “Fiori immortali” — packs a bit more of a cacophonous kick, as if metaphorical waves are picking up. The drum rhythms gallop along and carry powerful splashes of guitar riffing that have a somewhat psychedelic vibe at times, as if they’re the swirls of a whirlpool that Threestepstotheocean have brought listeners to the edge of. Following the heavy cacophony of “Profezie dalle rovine,” Del fuoco turns towards the simmering, heavy riffs of “Dispersi.” That song feels like it brings many of the album’s themes together, with a wide horizon packed into the song via the breathable vibe in much of the riffing, which itself carries a consistent churn, like a musical rip current. The album, as a whole, feels vibrantly fresh, like a journey to a previously undiscovered seaside, to take a cue from the picturesque band name.\n\nReview by Caleb Newton https://capturedhowls.com/2020/09/13/italys-threestepstotheocean-perform-majestic-post-rock-on-powerful-new-album/\n\n1.

            "description": "Alber Jupiter - We Are Just Floating In Space (Full Album) The pensive framework art and distant floating civilian sets the backstage for Alber Jupiter’s second release. The two-piece semi-instrumental act hailing from Rennes, France provide a deep pensive array of galactic tunes buttressed by some very impressive bass-work. The centric backbone of the 41 minute journey is the bass, the listener floating to the rich clarity and rhythms. Only \"Fangs\" really deviates from the formula infusing some King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard-like vibes, a solid lead in to the title track closer.  \"Uber en Colere\" takes the prize for its amazing contrast and poignant melodies. The most reflective and expansive of the six tracks is a standout for sure.  Blissed out kraut/psych that demands repeat listens; great stuff!\n\nReview by Rotation11 https://www.rotation11.com/post/alber-jupiter-we-are-just-floating-in-space\n\n1.  Intro - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Lambda - Heliopolis (Full Album) Also signified by the Greek letter from which they take their moniker, Czech four-piece Lambda represent a new age of progressive heavy post-rock. Influences from Russian Circles aren’t necessarily surprising to find coursing through the instrumental debut full-length, Heliopolis, but there are shades of Elder as well behind the more driving riffs and underlying swing of “Space Express,” which also featured on the band’s 2015 EP of the same name. The seven-minute “El Sonido Nuevo” did likewise, but older material or newer, the album’s nine-song procession moves toward its culminating title-track through the grace of “Odysea” and the intertwining psychedelic guitars of “Milkyway Phaseshifter” with an overarching atmosphere of the journey to the city of the sun being undertaken. And when they get there, at the closer, there’s an initial sense of peace that gives way to some of the most directly heavy push Heliopolis has to offer. Payoff, then. So be it. Purposeful and somewhat cerebral in its execution, the DIY debut brings depth and space together to immersive effect.\n\nReview from The Obelisk https://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/lambda-heliopolis/\n\n1.

            "description": "Cloud - Deus Ex Machina (Full Album) Cloud is an Instrumental Progressive Rock band, from Bloomsburg, PA.  Deus Ex Machina is a six-song concept album that focuses on the hubristic nature of mankind, the conflict we all assume that we are invulnerable to, as well as the aftermath that ultimately follows. Cloud begins their sophomore record with “Part One: Before the Fall”, which sets the tone for the remainder of the album: dark and heavy, albeit melodic and poignant. The second track, “Part Two: The Ruin of Man”, begins with clean, tranquil guitars and closes with an explosion of heavy riffs, psychedelic solos, and monstrous drums.\n\nThe album’s title track “Deus Ex Machina” follows and opens with thunderous tribal drums, which symbolize the ritualistic summoning of ‘The God from the Machine,’ who is the only hope for the human race. Track four, “Our Darkest Hour”, slows the album down to a doomy yet melodic overture and represents the primordial human belief that when death is all but certain, we always put our faith into a higher power. The penultimate track, “As the Dust Settles”, is the band’s gift to longtime fans—the direct spawn of “Grim Reefer” and “Cosmic Carousal”, as it were. Finally, the album closes with “Neogenesis”, which along with being the album’s most upbeat track, also contains an obvious and intentional nod to some of the pioneers of stoner metal.\n \n1.  Part One: Before The Fall - 0:00\n2.  Part Two: Ruin Of Man - 5:40\n3.  Deus Ex Machina - 14:02\n4.  Our Darkest Hour - 20:25\n5.  As The Dust Settles - 28:20\n6.

Mostly influenced by classic 70’s bands (Black Sabbath, King Crimson, Yes, Rush, Deep Purple…), and the modern psychedelic scene (Elder, Karma to burn, Atomic Bitchwax, king gizzard, Hypnos69). Recording live without overproducing, the band focuses on the authenticity and unaltered spontaneity that made the rock records we all love.  Their first album \"A-B\", recorded in 2015, was released in January 2016.  Their second album \"C-D\", which is more prog oriented, was released in October 2020.\n\n1.  C1 - 0:00\n2.  C2 - 4:53\n3.

            "description": "Oddplay - Soundscape (Full Album) Oddplay are two guys (Itso Nikoloff and Alexander Enev) who share the vibe and love for psychedelic stoner rock. They are independent artists from Varna, Bulgaria who record, mix and master their instrumental music all by themselves. Oddplay are very happy to share their music with all fans of the genre.  Soundscape is their latest full length album, their 3rd of the year.  It is a dark, psychedelic wonder perfect for a late-night drive or simply when you are in the mood for something heavy but sensual, melodic but odd. \n\nThe album is entirely instrumental, letting you savour every emphatic strum of the guitar and the groovy bass. Some tracks feel like bringing you into a cerebral psychedelic experience, while others convey the grit and tremor of something more old-school. Some of them may also feel kind of light-hearted and melodic, as if watching a beautiful sunset during the first day of a desolate apocalypse. This all makes for a very unique and cathartic listening experience as the album weaves each subsequent track into a wonderful malady of styles and vibes.\n\n1.  Chasing Odds - 0:00\n2.  Obelisk - 3:37\n3.  Cast Away - 7:30\n4.  My Sin - 11:19\n5.  Sad Cat Eating Wet Bread - 15:00\n6.  Pauper's Groove - 18:30\n7.  The Dark Passenger - 22:17\n8.  Multisense - 25:49\n9.

            "description": "Crypt Witch - Bad Trip Exorcism (Full Album) Crypt Witch is an instrumental Stoner doom band from Germany with emphasis on slow, heavy and hypnotic riffs.  Bad Trip Exorcism is their debut album, released in 2019. With the help of a magic spell book written in the blood of a young virgin, supported by a large portion of marijuana and a huge guitar in his hands, he expels the spirits tormenting the people. Hypnotizing drums are put into trance, revealing the darkest corners of the subconscious.  At their call, evil spirits are led and climb out of their holes. They can not resist the weight of the guitar and disappear in its slow and heavy sound. And if you are harassed by evil spirits, it is time to listen to the album \"Bad Trip Exorcism\" and to conduct your own exorcism.\n\n1.  Holy Gila Monster - 0:00\n2.  Dope Witch - 11:42\n3.  Bad Trip Exorcism - 21:48\n4.  Acid Wizard - 29:26\n5.  Marijuana Zombie - 38:55\n\nSupport Crypt Witch by purchasing the album here https://cryptwitch.bandcamp.com/album/bad-trip-exorcism\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cryptwitch\n\nIf you appreciate this channel, please consider becoming a Patron.

            "description": "Jesus The Snake - Black Acid, Pink Rain (New Full Album) For those feeling adventurous, Portugal’s Jesus the Snake follow-up their 2017 self-titled EP with the unmitigated warmth of Black Acid, Pink Rain, their live-recorded full-length debut.  Not one piece of the five total on the 49-minute offering is under eight minutes long, and sandwiched between opener “Karma” and the closing title-track are three cuts circa nine that prove no less hypnotic. The beginning of “Floyds I” is so fluid with the interplay of organ and guitar that one almost expects a gentle Portuguese spoken word verse to start, but of course one never does. Instead, Jesus the Snake complement mindful drift with flashes of more weighted or active fare, all the while holding to a central vibe that is peaceful even as “Duna” finds its chill before the halfway point, with no loss of spirit in the process. \n\nAn evolutionary, creative and marvelous pilgrimage through the deserts of the mind, with barefoot to wavy, silken and amorous dunes, petrified and beheld by the setting sun, and head buried in the dense and intoxicating astral nebulosity. Dwell in the dazzling mysticism that halos the entire temporal body of this album and feel yourself slumbering in a pleasant stage of inertia that will lead you to the longed for reign of the spiritual trance.\n\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/jesus-the-snake/\n\n1.  Karma - 0:00\n2.  Floyds I - 10:22\n3.  Floyds II - 19:31\n4.  Duna - 28:28\n5.

            "description": "Here The Captain Speaking, The Captain Is Dead - Self Titled (Full Album)  From the opening bars of ‘Odyssey’ this music from the Hawkwind-esquely titled Here The Captain Speaking, The Captain Is Dead sent me off on a real feel-good mood that keeps going for the whole length of the album, and then a bit after that. They are a three-piece from Valencia in Spain: Adrián (guitars, synths), Dela  (bass guitar) Dela and Lucas (drums), and together they take us on a journey through the sonic universe that begins in the 1970s. It’s a wholly instrumental album, the aforementioned ‘Odyssey’ rises out of the speakers like watching the sun rising over a planet from space as there is a moment of shoegaze before the rhythm of this track bangs in and were away on a motorik journey to the stars.\n\nIf anything ‘Cult of Youth’ ups the ante with it’s high tempo rhythm section and repeato theme that gives the track a real sense of build… you feel like the music in not only becoming more intense but also dense before 2’30” in it ejaculates into  a punk guitar before powering off in search of the cosmic edge. This isn’t space rock… it’s full on rawk.   As everywhere on this album, they blend elements of kraut and other forms of 70s rock music into a blend that feels bang up to date. They bring the album home with ‘Event Horizon’, a large slab of clearly improvised music which is played with such freedom that you just cannot help being drawn into it. Like the rest of the album it just moves along with a sort of natural purpose as if it was a tune that was always meant to be played.\n\nReview by Simon https://fragmentedflaneur.com/2018/11/27/album-review-here-the-captain-speaking-the-captain-is-dead-s-t/\n\n1.

            "description": "Cracked Machine - Gates Of Keras (New Full Album) Originally formed in Wiltshire in 2015 by guitarist Bill Denton, Cracked Machine is a quartet of experienced musicians brought together in a quest for aural mayhem.  Following the release of their debut album, I, Cosmonaut, the band wasted no time in releasing an exceptional follow-up. Featuring hook-laden guitars that conjured soaring post-rock vistas, The Call of the Void presented a huge progression in the band's song writing and showcased a leaner, meaner, and ultimately, heavier sounding machine.  Just over a year later they've released the follow up, 'Gates Of Keras'.  It's an album of breathless intensity, and highly recommended for all lovers of psych and instrumental rock.\n\n1.  Cold Iron Light - 0:00\n2.  Temple of Zaum - 7:25\n3.  Black Square Icon - 11:41\n4.  The Wood Demon - 16:55\n5.  Move 37 - 21:50\n6.  October Dawn - 25:22\n7.  Low Winter Sun - 31:03\n8.

            "description": "Sex Blender - The Second Coming (New Full Album) The story of Sex Blender began in April 2017 after a garage jam session in L’viv, Ukraine. The band captures a blend of classic 70’s and modern psych. They create epic compositions which include a vibrant mix of motoric, drone, blues, oriental, dub, post rock, metal and classic rock. Their music is instrumentally based, laden with heavy amounts of psychedelia and space rock, both of which resonate with enticing garnishes that one could attribute to krautrock. It is served in a most fluid state, chilled but with just the right amount of blues in an almost improve-like sonic decanter.  The Second Coming is their new sophomore full length album, the follow up to 2018's Hormonizer.\n\n1.  Departure (intro) - 0:00\n2.  Retrograde Delux - 3:16\n3.  Crimson Master - 15:17\n4.

            "description": "Vircator - Arcano (New Full Album)  Vircator was formed in 2012 in Portugal. With their latest album “Acrano”, Vircator invite you to take a deep ride into cosmic and volcanic landscapes. Although the band’s identity is maintained, this album is an authentic surprise: it’s a powerful, and emotional ride, balanced by calm and sweeping moments.  The four-piece collective takes a new step on experimenting dimensional dramatic instrumentals, searching for new sounds, emotions and textures, and exploring the polarity of quiet and loud, complexity and simplicity, ugliness and beauty to the same time.  Vircator’s sound is a powerful and emotional ride that takes you deep into the human conscience, balanced by calm and sweeping moments.\n\n1.  Burdock - 0:00\n2.  Lady Fern - 5:50\n3.  Yarrow - 11:04\n4.  Mandrake - 16:15\n5.  Agrimony - 21:11\n6.

            "description": "Hazy Sea - Coast Of The Immortals (New Full Album) Hazy Sea is an instrumental band from Greece formed in 2015, exploring the stoner/desert rock sound.  Warning, an over-use of sea-faring metaphors awaits ye! These Greek instrumentalists navigate stoner rock’s choppier waters….but with a 70’s prog twist! After setting sail it’s not long before calmer oceans are navigated and Hazy Sea‘s prog intentions wash over you; culminating in a swathe of beautiful, calming excursions into the most mesmerising guitar playing imaginable.\n\nTo call Cargo Incognito background music sounds derogatory but these laid-back paeans to 70’s guitar gods such as Clapton and Gilmour are the perfect accompaniment to whatever you may be doing.  Restrained, mellow and technically brilliant throughout, these 7 tracks seep into your consciousness by the sheer warming nature of their sound and with more than a little Pink Floyd (and particularly David Gilmour’s solo work) informing the core of their music, Hazy Sea are awash with nostalgia, harking back to the days of mind-altering experimentation and honest-to-goodness musicianship.\n\n1.  Coast Of The Immortals - 0:00\n2.  Atlantis - 5:23\n3.  The West Side Of East - 9:36\n4.  Waves Of Eternity - 16:23\n5.  Black Seagull - 21:38\n6.  Mermaid - 26:53\n7.  Mud - 31:56\n8.

            "description": "ÖfÖ Am - Tales From Outerspace: An Octaman's Odyssey (Full Album) ÖfÖ Am is an instrumental heavy rock band from France. Influenced by bands ranging from Deep Purple to Unsane through Black Sabbath and Kyuss, ÖfÖ AM has chosen to remain instrumental and focus each of its pieces around a central theme. Hidden in the shadows, ÖfÖ AM has furbished its tentacles, sharpened its aerial and indomitable stoner. Since their beginning in 2009, the band has released an Ep, an Album and 2 splits (including one with Karma To Burn) and has played all across Europe.\n\nIn \"Tales From Outerspace: An Octaman's Odyssey.\" ÖfÖ AM invites you to travel in an imaginary film: Octaman, a sprawling hero of modern times who will cross deserts and tribal landscapes and get lost in the narrow and stinking streets of intergalactic megacities, he will settle his accounts in spaceships and save his species from extinction in epic battles .... ÖfÖ Am is back and it's going to rock! This record is solid 70's 80's hard rock and metal. VERY tuneful and never too heavy. What's amazing is that OfO AM actually manage to make this music sound like a soundtrack in heavy rock form. \n\n1.  Bamakö - 0:00\n2.  Gergövie - 4:50\n3.  Eddy's Funeral - 9:34\n4.

            "description": "Sex Blender - Hormonizer (Full Album) What an extraordinary debut album from the Ukrainian Sex Blender. “Hormonizer” fascinatingly blends psychedelic rock with blues and stoner rock, carefully driven by a krautrock atmosphere, even with space for some drone inputs.  Their music is instrumentally based, laden with heavy amounts of psychedelia and space rock, both of which resonate with enticing garnishes that one could attribute to krautrock. It is served in a most fluid state, chilled but with just the right amount of blues in an almost improv-like sonic decanter.\n\n“Pterozister” is the perfect place for the guys to stretch their musical muscles. They do exactly that in a variety of aural exercises, but first the song teeters within a very minimalist, stripped down state at its start. Atmospherically heady and immensely hypnotic, you feel as if you’re being pulled into the cosmic infinite right from the get-go.\n\n“Das Morotik” is the album’s shortest song, landing just a bit shy of six minutes… but what an almost six minutes it is! Uptempo and chock full of energized groove propelling it, the track is a fine example of the more jammy side of Sex Blender‘s nature. These tripped-out Ukrainians have put sex in a blender, and it sounds way less painful than you’d imagine. In fact, it’s super cool and colourful. \n\nReview by Pat Whitaker https://www.riffrelevant.com/2018/05/12/sex-blender-hormonizer-review-stream-fest-2018/\n\n1.  Das Motorik - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Son Cesano - Submerge (Full Album) Son Cesano are a psych stoner rock instrumental band with a really nice vibe. The Swiss four piece jam through six tracks that'll chill you out and brighten your mood.  What started in autumn 2015 with extensive jams slowly assumed a more structured shape. The result was a mixture of different stylistic elements characterized by instrumental, partly spherical, partly heavy fuzz sound. Heavy Psychedelic Sud Rock was born. \n\nThe debut album \"Submerge“ was recorded live in the legendary \"Foolpark“ record studio Lucerne and released on the first of December 2018. It depicts a journey down into the depths of beautiful, spacey soundscapes all the way to the bottom of a peculiar ocean, where downtuned guitars and fuzzy, transparent riffs await your arrival.  This is high quality stoner of the psych end, of Rotor or Los Natas and their ilk, and hard to feel anything else but a warmth towards it. \n\n1.  Submerge - 0:00\n2.  Cold Seep - 10:08\n3.  Aberration - 16:55\n4.  Martini Effect - 32:37\n5.  36070 - 37:12\n6.  Dust Age - 45:58\n\nSupport Son Cesano by purchasing the album here https://soncesano.bandcamp.com/album/submerge\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SonCesanoBand/\n\nSupport the continued funding of this channel, become a Patron https://www.patreon.com/MeadowOfDoom\n\nStoned Meadow Of Doom Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/StonedMeadowOfDoom/\n\nJoin the SMOD Nation Facebook Group! https://www.facebook.com/groups/188446978378035/",

With “Over Phlegethon”, the trio has created an utterly bleak, dark and devastating album that combines heavy riffs, drone-like atmospheres and an intensity you only find in Black Metal. Using instruments like the djembe, rag-dung, violin, bowed guitars and saxophone, alongside a normal band set-up, Five the Hierophant, regale the listeners with unique and varied soundscapes on this, their debut full-length album.\n\n1.

            "description": "Liquify - Liquify (Full Album) The Debut Album of Liquify, which combines many creative influences ranging from the psychedelic mixture of twin guitar solos, an old western feel, and wrapping up with a lengthy Desert/Stoner rock trance. Inspired by bands such as Pink Floyd, Santana, Sleep, The Re-Stoned, and Earthless, Liquify is a one-man project from the United States that strives to bring balance to the Rock. Beginning with Aurora, the dual guitars are introduced along with a steady bass that gradually builds to a climax. Vibrant has a groovy flow that is complimented by the bass riff with the guitar licks as the icing on the cake. The Stars Dance Above Us builds into something greater and has a reminiscent feel about the strangeness of what lies above us. Dust City Blues offers an old western style with a touch of the 70s rock. Desertman leads into a groovy trip and might be something one would expect while driving through the desert on a blazing hot day. Finally, Voyage of the Sun is a lengthy distortion driven journey of the Sun that ascends towards its climax and claims its position as the longest song on the album. \n\n1.  Aurora - 0:00\n2.  Vibrant - 7:12\n3.  The Stars Dance Above Us - 11:29\n4.  Dust City Blues - 20:58\n5.  Desertman - 24:49\n6.

            "description": "Flynotes -  The Goddess Of Sunrise (New Full Album) Flynotes are an instrumental heavy rock band from Saint Petersburg, Russia, which was formed in 2010. In 2011, they released a first full-length studio album, Our Zoo, followed in 2013 by a second self-released album, called Shiva Telescopes.  After some silence, the band returned in 2016 with a digital EP, The Smell Of Space, and very recently, with a renewed line-up, Flynotes released Child In The Woods in 2018.  Now they've released their brand new album 'The Goddess Of Sunrise'.  What the trio brings is an instrumental mixture of different yet closely related styles and sub-genres, such as Doom Metal, Stoner, Psychedelic, Post Rock and Progressive. The material is guitar-based, done by extremely heavy electric guitar riffs and monumental leads.  The melodies are supported by a truly fantastic rhythm section, which includes pushing and pounding rhythm guitars, almost hypnotic bass lines and monumental drum patterns. \n\n1.

            "description": "Philosophers - Alaska (New Full Album) Philosophers is a Hungarian band formed back in 2014. The band’s former lineup created music that contained lyrics, but after being left without a singer and also following the advice of their record label at the time, they decided to stick with instrumental music.\nTheir first album, Handmade (2015) was based on this concept that they tried to improve by new impulses and harmonizations on their following album, Dance (2016). After a short break, the band recorded their newest album, Alaska. The style of the record harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s and tries to imitate the old school sounding of that era, with a little bit of modern influence.\n\n1.

They create guitar based instrumental music which combines ancient Greek musical modes, heavy rock riffs and melodic musical elements of the past. This is their journey to Ithaca. Excellent debut studio disc by this outstanding instrumental stoner rock band from Greece featuring 10 awesome songs of mind-altering riffage from the musical guitar rock minds of Stavros Papadopoulos & Panagiotis Zabourlis. \n\nBoth guitarists are on the cutting edge of the Greek Stoner Rock Revolution and have produced an impressive, shape-shifting, musical journey that takes the listener to the outskirts of infinity and beyond. Inspired heavily by their Greek Heritage; \"Mythologica\" is an intoxicating blend of dynamic six string mojo that is highly recommended to fans of the Universal Hippies, Stone Age Mammoth, Stonilla & Hazy Sea. Dive in deep and fly high close to the sun with the essential Children Of Aegean \"Mythologica\" disc.\n\n1.  Sisyphus - 0:00\n2.  Delos - 5:33\n3.  Caryatis - 10:27\n4.  Morpheus - 15:41\n5.

            "description": "Temnee - Dialectics (Remastered) (Full Album) Temnee is Heavy Psych/Instrumental Stoner from Tver, Russia. \"Dialectics\", the debut full-length album of Temnee, the band from Tver, Russia, is finally coming out on vinyl via Sound Effect Records! That is powerful instrumental heavy-psych stoner with deep and thick riffs, psychedelic passages, southern blues jams, oriental melodies, a lot of Sabbath's legacy and a krautrock drive.  Temnee was created in 2013 in Tver, Russia. Their first 5-track, \"Astrodiving\" EP, was released in 2014. That cinematic minion with a lot of jams and fat riffs was followed by the full-length album \"Dialectics\", released digitally in 2016. Dialectics is a philosophical concept meaning the evolution of ideas: a dispute where truth is born. It perfectly describes the process of album creation. \n\nOn \"Dialectics\" Temnee continues exploring cosmic horizons of heavy space rock. Moreover, the musicians have recently immersed into adjacent genres such as kraut and blues. Powerful sound will transfer you first to the opium haze of the Middle East, then to the Martian race! A turn to the foggy and cruel \"Middle Ages\" finally makes you feel the grievous fate of an astronaut living his last moments in outer space.  Spiritualistic session in space. Supersonic travel to singularity on an acid fuzz. Epic odyssey in the depths of consciousness. Hypnotic jams with orgasmic catharsis. Outstanding psychedelic trip iridescent with all shades of outer and inner space, all that's Temnee. \n\n1.  Steps To Infinity - 0:00\n2.  Doom. To Do Doom - 5:51\n3.  Voron - 10:35\n4.  Rise - 17:46\n5.  Carcassonne - 23:10\n6.  The Red Desert Drive - 24:17\n7.  Gravity and Heartbeat (Last 7 Minutes In Space) - 31:16\n8.

            "description": "Yawning Man - Macedonian Lines (New Full Album) Formed in 1986, Yawning Man are the original stoner/desert rock band you may not have heard of but just because ‘you weren’t there, man’ doesn’t mean you should ignore a band once described by scene legend Brant Bjork as “the GREATEST band I’ve ever seen”. Yawning Man continue to establish their exceptionally unique approach to rock music on the bands latest album \" Macedonian Lines\" (Heavy Psych Sounds Records) This follow up to the critically acclaimed \"Revolt Against Tired Noises\" shows a further maturing of melody, dynamics and emotion in the bands song writing.  Yawning Mans roots lay at the foundation of the desert rock and stoner rock sub genres however the music the band creates is truly organic and visceral, conjuring a flowing imagery and a emotional response. \n\nOn this release the band has a darker and massively heavier sound than past recordings as most of these tracks were developed in live performance and then fully realized in the studio. Yawning Man returned to Gatos Trail Studio in the Joshua Tree CA desert to record this album and the space and beauty of the surroundings is ever present in every track. Heavy, beautiful, and delicate. Gary Arce, Mario Lalli and Bill Stinson continue to expand and dig deep with every track.  A band renowned for sojourns into epic instrumental jams, on Macedonian Lines Yawning Man may have reigned in the excess but, overall, they simply sound timeless; conjuring absorbing, ever-evolving, ageless tomes which ebb and flow through seemingly seamless improvisation and a psych style all of their own.\n\n1.

            "description": "The Dry Mouths - Memories From Pines Bridge (New Full Album) The Dry Mouths are a power trio based in Almería Desert City, Spain.  'Memories From Pines Bridge’ is their sixth album and was released April 5th, 2019. It is a 40-minute LP composed of 9 tracks performed live as “jam sessions” and instrumental passages of psycho-hypnotic character.  For those familiar with the Almeria-based trio’s past work, it will no doubt seem like something of a departure from their generally straightforward desert-rocking songcraft, which may or may not be rooted in jams, but ultimately pushes much farther out here in songs like “Impromental VII – Moustachette,” a nine-minute off-the-cuff exploration of canyon echoes and cymbal wash, or the earlier “Low Savvia,” which brings a bit of thicker distortion to the dream-toned modus of Yawning Man. \n\nThe instrumental outing is a departure even just for its lack of vocals, but the resonant tonality and the adventurous spirit of the sonic interaction between the three-piece of guitarist/thereminist Christ O. Rodrigues, bassist Andrés Reyes and drummer Josh Morales makes it a joyful undertaking despite the tragic circumstances of its arrival following the death of Reyes in February.  Memories from Pines Bridge is one of two albums The Dry Mouths will reportedly release in 2019 in that most unfortunate of contexts, and while there hasn’t been any information given on whether it will follow the band’s more established methodology or the the dry mouths memories from pines bridgepattern set forth by these tracks, there’s no denying that what they’re doing here works. \n\nWith Rodrigues‘ guitar drifting outward in pieces like “Promenade” or “Mangai Maroke” or conjuring desert visions in opener “La Chasseure,” or delving into minimalist ambience on “Bootha,” there’s a sense of patterning behind most of what the band are doing here. With the exception of the aforementioned “Impromental VII – Moustachette” and “El Cairo ’78” right before it, most of the tracks are under five minutes long, and the theremin-laced “L’Enfer” is 63 seconds, so while they range far in the nine songs, it’s still just a 40-minute outing, and that too feels purposeful. Songs ease their way in and gently fade out, like the penultimate “Bootha” or “El Cairo ’78” after “L’Enfer,” and even when The Dry Mouths build a wash, they do so with patience and melodic emphasis. It sounds like it was a joy to make, and that carries into the execution of the songs themselves, as well as the listening experience.\n\nImmersion is the key. Hypnosis is the key. The Dry Mouths are issuing an invitation to get lost with them. Closer “La Siesta (Sleep Paralysis)” has a little bit of a darker foundation, but the vast, vast majority of Memories from Pines Bridge is dedicated to sweetly melodic instrumentalist passages of these fleeting musical ideas that weave their way in and out fluidly as the album progresses. It’s the kind of record that is exceedingly easy to put on and lose time with. “What just happened?” and on it goes again. Its blend of plotted material and improv keeps things moving in a way that adds a subtle sense of variety, and no matter where the band seems to head, they’re able to bring the listener along with them for the ride. And their scope is pretty broad while being tethered to its desert rock foundation, so while you might get lost in listening to it, the band are never really any more lost than they want to be in their playing.\n\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/the-dry-mouths-memories-from-pines-bridge/\n\n1.

            "description": "Cracked Machine - The Call of the Void (New Full Album) Based in Wiltshire, UK, Cracked Machine weave together hypnotic grooves, infectious riffs and layers of sonic texture to create compelling and original soundscapes which take fellow cosmic explorers on an exhilarating trip through the cosmos. The West Country, the South East corner of England famed for its history and beauty, is also renowned for producing devastating heaviness with a soupçon of versatility. Step forward Cracked Machine who, since emerging from Wiltshire in 2015, have surfed both cosmos and deserts out of the reach of radar. Second album The Call Of The Void (PsyKa Records) follows on swiftly from last year’s debut I, Cosmonaut and despite the short timespan between the two, it’s a more mature progression. \n\nOpener ‘Jormungandr’ sees a light sound underpinned by oscillating effects, with growling riffs riding the back of a robust, metronomic beat and Bill Denton’s guitarwork switching from those riffs to a throaty, post-Rock style lead. There’s an element of Desert kings Yawning Man about the chiming chords and middling trot, but with an added emotional depth and sense of might from the growing rhythms: the ponderous tones of the ensuing ‘Illuyanka’ speak of a loneliness around the warmth of a campfire, a feeling of nostalgia whipped up by spring-like airs as both volume and emphasis swell languidly around Denton’s gorgeous solos.\n\nThe guitar doesn’t hog the limelight, however. The brooding, explosive jam ‘Kirimu’ is as much of a vehicle for Chris Sutton’s fizzing, fluid bass and Clive Noyes’ 80s synth, while Blazej Gradziel’s drums continue as the glue holding it all together. The sombre jangling of ‘Yamata No Orocchi’ again grows wonderfully into adulthood and sees those drums really come to the fore in a blend of power and subtlety, with Noyes’ distant vocal wails an intriguing accompaniment to the low, melodic riff. Gradziel remains a primary factor during the following ‘Azi Dahakar’, his deft yet heavy and easy-paced work giving a solid platform for the poignant, atmospheric keys and Denton’s emotive storytelling.\n\nRhythm dominates the early stages of the portentous ‘Typhon’, Noyes presenting a constant chord as a spectral underpin for Denton’s later surges of electricity: while picked chords and haunting synth lead euphoric closer ‘Vritra’ and blend to stunning effect during both periods of introspection and fulmination. The Call Of The Void, while showcasing the great talent of all members, is choc-full of the stuff and also displays wonderful songcraft. This is no cracked machine: it’s working in grand harmony. \n\nReview by Paul Quinn http://www.ghostcultmag.com/album-review-cracked-machine-the-call-of-the-void-psyka-records/\n\n1.

            "description": "Hhoogg - Earthling, Go Home! (New Full Album) Space is the place where you’ll find Boston improvisationalists Hhoogg, who extend their fun penchant for adding double letters to the leadoff “Ccoossmmooss” of their exclamatory second self-released full-length, Earthling, Go Home!, which brings forth seven tracks in a vinyl-ready 37 minutes and uses that opener also as its longest track to set a molten tone to the proceedings while subsequent vibes in “Rustic Alien Living” and the later, bass-heavy “Recalled to the Pyramids” range from the Hendrixian to the funkadelicness he helped inspire. \n\nWith a centerpiece in “Star Wizard, Headless and Awake,” a relatively straightforward three-minute noodler, the four-piece choose to cap with “Infinitely Gone,” which feels as much like a statement of purpose and an aesthetic designation as a descriptor for what’s contained within. In truth, it’s a little under six minutes gone, but jams like these tend to beg for repeat listens anyway. There’s some growing to do, but the melding of their essential chemistry is in progress, and that’s what matters most. The rest is exploration, and they sound well up for it.\n\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/hhoogg-earthling-go-home/\n\n1.  Ccoossmmooss - 0:00\n2.

This region of the country rich with post-apocalyptic-like nature scenery, face melting wind melodies and almighty mountains incubated their music as she emerged in the form of long, heavy, groovy, psy instrumental jams. The Last Second is the first full length album of the band and comes as a reward after all these music making years. In order to capture the magic, it was recorded live.\n\nThe result is a mixture of sharp grooves, dreamy yet aggresive guitar melodies and tight bass lines. Recordings took place at BlackBox Studio and for the mixing and mastering process they worked besides the good lads at Unreal Studio (Planet of Zeus, Puta Volcano, etc). Over the years they have shared the stage with a number of great bands that where Influential to their sound, such as: Jakob (NZ), Toundra (ES), Elder (USA), Samsara Blues Experiment (DE).

Riding a motorcycle on the highway through a Desert music.  You know the kind.\n\nRock fans, it's finally on the way & available for pre order!!\nA very limited run of both \"WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T GET HIGH AT 95MPH\" & \"HOW THE WEST WAS LOST AND OTHER VIVID HALLUCINATIONS\", joined at the hip & presented on 2 disc's in a gatefold cover illustrated by the very talented Alexander Von Wieding. Pressed in Karlsruhe Germany on 180g black vinyl & shipped worldwide around October the 10th.\nThere have been a lot of requests for a vinyl release over the years.

            "description": "Da Captain Trips - Adventures in the Upside Down (Full Album).  Da Captain Trips are a jam band plying their trade out of Italy. They formed \"as a joke in 2009 by three overweight beardy friends\" - their words not mine! They are a band who can seem strangely overlooked by the psych community.  Da Captain Trips have always been a band not constrained by one single approach to music making, they incorporate many different styles, genres etc in their output making them always interesting and always worth checking out. 'Adventures In The Upside Down'  is no different - taking in psychedelia, Space Rock, Prog, krautrock and even surf and, all in all, a damn fine listen! \n\n'The Calm And The Storm' opens the album with a long, drawn out drone and some electronic effects before a lonesome guitar is heard over the drone - it's all very melancholic and sounding distinctly nautical, with a 'twanging' downbeat surfy vibe. The track opens up to become a motoring psych/space rock number with flashes of kosmische electronica under the guitar. 'Manta' has an intro that reminded me of the 'Knightrider' theme - random I know!. However, it immediately transforms into another chuggin' track with more than a hint of krautrock about it...so far, so great. 'Revelation' is something different altogether....the twang heard in the first track returns with vengeance...a trippy, surf vibe is built, like Jan and Dean on acid, broken only by passages of more cosmic electronica and jazzy psych with saxophone courtesy of Lee Relfe from Sendelica. It's a great track that leaves the listener wondering where things are going next.\n\n'Dear Zahdia' has a very retro feel about it, the vibe is very seventies with flashes of prog, mainly due to the organ sounding synth work. As the track travels it's course things become heavier and far more psych. 'Trespasses Bay - Peaceful Place' is the longest and most complex of the tracks. It has again that wonderful twang guitar giving it a surf feel and, like the previous track, it does have a proggy feel at times but in the main it is a slowburning, psychedelic meander, chocked full of atmosphere and plenty of reverb. The last section has some great electronica that once again takes us back to the seventies.\n\n\nThe album is brought to a close by 'Mother Earth'...starting with some bucolic guitar that is bordering on folk, it is an initially pastoral track that shows another side to the band - a side that is not afraid to eschew their psychedelic musings for something more introspective and contemplative... for a while at least..it blossoms into a superlative jam as it nears the end of it's ten minute length. 'Adventures In The Upside Down' is a great album, full of invention and wonder - taking different aspects of the 'psych' world and mixing them to form an album that is actually remarkably restful and evocative. It is still as trippy as hell in places but, maybe more than their other recordings, more reliant on technique and craft rather than all out jamfests. It is, in short, a 'grown up' album.\n\nReview from Dayzofpurpleandorange http://dayzofpurpleandorange.blogspot.com/2017/04/review-da-captain-trips-adventures-in.html\n\n1.

            "description": "Full album stream plus film of Zeitgeber's Heteronomy.  Zeitgeber's Heteronomy is an exploration of psychedelic, ambient, world and electronic music. You’ll hear hints of Balkan and African rhythms, washes of reverb-soaked textures, and instrumentation as eclectic as ‘caisa’ handpan, clarinet, didgeridoo, ‘sansula’ thumb piano, melodica, guitar and viola.  Conceptually the album is a homage to the hidden forces and environmental stimuli that regulate and modulate human behaviour and psychology - like a zeitgeber, a rhythmically occurring natural phenomenon which acts as a cue in the regulation of the body's circadian rhythms. \n\nHeteronomy is the Sydney, Australia duo's debut release.  On Heteronomy the polyrhythmic electro world grooves on display wade through the band’s deep fascination with the deep inner workings of the human mind from a spiritual perspective. The album is strewn with fascinating references to spirituality and the mechanics of perception itself and the music is just bullshit cool.  Throughout the release you’ll hear multiple acoustic and electric sounds blend and pop in and out to create a truly broad array of sounds, the way the sounds blend is done in such a considered way in that acoustic sources (like the Kalimba on the track ‘Circadian Rhythms’) are so well processed with washy verbs and stuff that they integrate seamlessly with everything else. Where this becomes really enjoyable is in assuming that, this band clearly has a lot of tricks up their sleeve, and something that might seem on surface level to be quite simple is actually bafflingly intricate in its textural arrangement.\n\nComplimenting that is the rhythmic component that creates the backbone of truly dazzling moments in this album. It’s so so hard to describe the feeling that comes with the rhythmic component being so prominent and so complex in this realm of music, it’s just a cathartic wash, it’s like it disables a part of the brain that is so affixed to driving rawk drum bullshit (even outside of band genres), the interplay between each instrument rhythmically is to my ears just so enveloping, it’s like hearing a master ambient maker at work.  Heteronomy is a unique and engrossing listen that will please fans of Dawn Of Midi, Manu Delago’s Living Room, Portico Quartet, Estradasphere, and anyone interested in the fusion of music from across the globe.\n\nReview by Anthony Cooley http://echoesanddust.com/2017/04/zeitgeber-heteronomy/\n\n1.

Released in September 1970, it was the band's only LP to top the UK Albums Chart until the release of the '13' album in 2013. Paranoid contains several of the band's signature songs, including \"Iron Man\", \"War Pigs\" and the title track, which was the band's only Top 20 hit, reaching number 4 in the UK charts. It is often cited as the most influential album in the development of the entire heavy metal genre.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/BlackSabbath\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/BlackSabbath\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/BlackSabbath\nWebsite: http://BlackSabbath.com\nSpotify: http://bit.ly/SabSpot\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/BlackSabbath\n\n#BlackSabbath #Paranoid #FullAlbum",

            "description": "Cloud - Indeterminate (Full Album) Remember \"Unpolished\" from Clouds 2015 EP? Well the first title track on Indeterminate takes you down memory lane... only this time with brutal force! The thunderous acoustic journey takes you to a wide open crunchy landscape where the riffs electrify for an in your face doom party! This song is mean! Climaxing to a dark atmospheric world and finally grounding you and sending you on your way home as the song ends. Track 2, Relapse, well let's just say it's the CLOUD we all remember. Bringing us back to similar sounds from the bands first EP. The guitar work on this song is some kind of genius. Riff after riff after sonic tube driven riff! This one will keep you coming back for that \"One last hit, I swear\". And if you think it couldn't get any better, you my friend are dead wrong! Track 3, Desert Weed, featuring guest vocals from the front man of the Argentina based doom trio Mephistofeles. This collaboration will surely have you packing that bong with the finest sea of green. \n\nPowerful riffs, punchy bass, and an all around classic stoner rock vibe. Take a ride, turn it up, and hot box the shit out of your moms mini van! Otherworldly is the fourth track on \"Indeterminate\". This song doesn't keep you waiting. Straight out the gate with more of that stoner rock we love. A very straight forward approach that winds down to a thick build up that lifts your spirit into a mind bending \"other world\". It doesn't stop there... the midway point of this journey will keep you banging your head as the power trio unleashes one of the heaviest riffs we hear on the album. Still. Doesnt. Stop. Progressively taking you deeper into this strange world, Cloud finishes you off with a bridge that will be remembered and finally a euphoric end of travels.  And last but not least, the finale.. For those of you that need to brush up on your Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the sacred \"ash tree\" that extends into the 9 different worlds. The opening riff says it all. Leading you into a very bass heavy, atmospheric bridge. A bridge to one of the 9 worlds? Either way, we're going somewhere! This jam extends into a full throttle journey into the world of riffage and finally ending with a doom explosion that will leave a mess in your pants. Let's face it. Indeterminate is a solid release from front to back!!!!\n\nReview from Marty M. Joyner @ The Doom Press\n\n1.  Indeterminate - 0:00\n2.  Relapse - 10:48\n3.  Desert Weed - 17:40\n4.  Otherworldly - 26:15\n5.  Yggdrasil - 35:33\n\nSupport Cloud by purchasing the album here https://cl0ud.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/cl0ud1/\n\nSupport the continued funding of this channel, become a Patreon https://www.patreon.com/MeadowOfDoom\n\nCheck out Stoned Meadow Of Doom 2 for more excellent full albums! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqjcQwTNvsxQWT44N6ESrA\n\nStoned Meadow Of Doom Facebook Page https://www.facebook.com/StonedMeadowOfDoom/\n\nJoin the SMOD Nation Facebook Group! https://www.facebook.com/groups/188446978378035/",

Brant cites that the motivation of Sabbia was to bring the desert scene to a lot of people who haven't experienced it for themselves.'\n\nSabbia (Full title is Sabbia. A film by Kate McCabe with music by Brant Bjork) is a visual album visual album born of a collaboration between experimental filmmaker and artist Kate McCabe and low desert stoner rock prince, Brant Bjork. As a sonic and visual exploration of the desert that birthed the music, Sabbia is at times part psychedelic documentary, part landscape film and part home movie revealing the vastness of the generator party dreamscape. Shot in combinations of 16mm, Super 8mm and digital, the film traverses the wilds between the low and high deserts. Its intention was to bring the scene in a non-traditional way to Brant’s fans across the globe and is now renown and beloved internationally. McCabe’s cinematic style and highly detailed sound design is front and center here with her first feature. Sabbia is considered by many to be a treasure of the desert scene.\n\n1 Gonna Make The Ponies Trot\n2 El Rolo\n3 Future Freak\n4 Let The Truth Be Known\n5 Nectar Alamo\n6 Fresh Coffee\n7 Rock 'N' Role\n8 Cobra Jab\n9 Hinda 65 Return Flight\n10 Ultimate Kickback\n11 Kaleidoscope\n12 Heavy Nature\n13 Shrine\n14 Palm Tree Reader\n15 Cool Abdul\n16 Drums & Cocktails\n17 Joint Ritual\n'",
